Distribution pattern of mercury in northern Barents Sea and Eurasian Basin surface sediment,"Kohler, SG; Kull, LM; Heimbürger-Boavida, LE; De Freitas, TR; Sanchez, N; Ndungu, K; Ardelan, M","Marine sediment is a significant sink for the global pollutant mercury. In a rapidly changing Arctic region, mercury (Hg) bioaccumulation in the marine ecosystem remains a prominent environmental issue. Here, we report surface sediment (0-2 cm) concentrations of Hg and other toxic elements of interest (Cr, Ni, Zn, Cu, As, Cd, Pb) in the northern Barents Sea and Eurasian Basin. We observed average Hg concentrations of 65 +/- 23 ng/g with the highest concentration of 116 ng/g in the Eurasian Basin. Our calculated enrichment factors suggest low anthropogenic enrichment for mercury, chromium, nickel, and copper. Mercury and trace element geographic patterns are best explained by the origin and transportation of fine grain sediment towards the Eurasian Basin, with scavenging by both particulate organic carbon and metal oxides as significant delivery mechanisms.",2022,,MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN,185,,,WOS:000882414500005,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.114272,,#1,Kohler 2022,,marine; primary source; sediment
Natural copper-binding ligands in the Arctic Ocean. The influence of the Transpolar Drift (GEOTRACES GN04),"Arnone, V; Santana-Casiano, JM; González-Dávila, M; Planquette, H; Sarthou, G; Gerringa, LJA; González, AG","The Arctic Ocean is a unique biogeochemical environment characterized by low salinity surface waters, extensive sea-ice coverage, high riverine inputs, large shelf extension and the long residence time of deep waters. These characteristics determine the distribution of dissolved bio-essential trace metals, such as copper (Cu), and the dissolved organic-binding ligands capable of complexing it. This work reports the concentrations and conditional stability constants of dissolved Cu-binding ligands (L-Cu and log K-Cu2+L(cond)) measured in samples from the Polarstern (PS94) expedition, as part of the international GEOTRACES program (cruise GN04). Full-depth profile stations from the Barents Sea, Nansen Basin, Amundsen Basin and Makarov Basin were analysed by competitive ligand exchange-adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (CLE-AdCSV). The basins and water masses presented a wide range of L-Cu concentrations (range: 1.40 - 7.91 nM) and log K-Cu2+L(cond) values (range: 13.83 - 16.01). The highest variability of Cu-binding ligand concentrations was observed in surface waters (<= 200 m), and mean concentrations increased from the Barents Sea and Nansen Basin (2.15 +/- 0.31 nM and 1.93 +/- 0.35 nM, respectively) to the Amundsen (3.84 +/- 1.69 nM) and Makarov Basins (4.40 +/- 2.03 nM). The influence of the Transpolar Drift (TDP) flow path was observed in the Amundsen and Makarov Basins, especially on Cu-binding ligand concentrations (L-Cu range: 3.96 - 7.91 nM). In contrast, deep waters (>200 m) showed no significant differences between basins and water masses in terms of L-Cu concentrations (range: 1.45 - 2.78 nM) and log K-Cu2+L(cond) (range: 14.02 - 15.46). The presence of strong Cu-binding ligands (log K-Cu2+L(cond)>13) in surface waters stabilises the excess of dissolved copper (dCu) transported in the TPD and favours its export to the Fram Strait and Nordic Seas.",2023,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,10,,,WOS:001130472300001,10.3389/fmars.2023.1306278,,#2,Arnone 2023,,Cu environmental chemistry; marine; primary source
"Trace elements in marine particulate and surface sediments of Kongsfjorden, Svalbard Islands","Ardini, F; Bazzano, A; Rivaro, P; Soggia, F; Terol, A; Grotti, M","To investigate the occurrence and possible sources of trace metals in the marine environment of Kongsfjorden (Svalbard Islands, Norwegian Arctic), suspended particulate matter and surface sediments have been collected in July 2014 and analysed for major and trace elements. The sampling stations were chosen to be representative of different glacial runoff, anthropic impact and possible influence of Atlantic waters. It was found that Al, Ca, Co, Fe, K, Mg, Ti and V enter the fjord by the natural input of lithogenic particles from the glaciers, whereas Cd, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni and Zn of anthropogenic origin are mainly introduced through the intrusion of Atlantic waters. The study of metal availability in surface sediments indicated that the labile fraction, leachable in weak acidic conditions, represents only a minor portion (< 14 %) of the total element concentration, except for Cd, Cu and Mn.",2016,,RENDICONTI LINCEI-SCIENZE FISICHE E NATURALI,27,,183-190,WOS:000382669200019,10.1007/s12210-016-0524-8,,#3,Ardini 2016,,marine; primary source; sediment
Distribution of copper-binding ligands in Fram Strait and influences from the Greenland Shelf (GEOTRACES GN05),"Arnone, V; Santana-Casiano, JM; González-Dávila, M; Sarthou, G; Krisch, S; Lodeiro, P; Achterberg, EP; González, AG","The Fram Strait represents the major gateway of Arctic Ocean waters towards the Nordic Seas and North Atlantic Ocean and is a key region to study the impact of climate change on biogeochemical cycles. In the region, in-formation about trace metal speciation, such as copper, is scarce. This manuscript presents the concentrations and conditional stability constants of copper-binding ligands (LCu and log KcondCu2+L) in the water column of Fram Strait and the Greenland shelf (GEOTRACES cruise GN05). Cu-binding ligands were analysed by Competitive Ligand Exchange-Adsorptive Cathodic Stripping Voltammetry (CLE-ACSV) using salicylaldoxime (SA) as competitive ligand. Based on water masses and the hydrodynamic influences, three provinces were considered (coast, shelf, and Fram Strait) and differences were observed between regions and water masses. The strongest variability was observed in surface waters, with increasing LCu concentrations (mean values: Fram Strait = 2.6 +/- 1.0 nM; shelf = 5.2 +/- 1.3 nM; coast = 6.4 +/- 0.8 nM) and decreasing log KcondCu2+L values (mean values: Fram Strait = 15.7 +/- 0.3; shelf = 15.2 +/- 0.3; coast = 14.8 +/- 0.3) towards the west. The surface LCu concentrations obtained above the Greenland shelf indicate a supply from the coastal environment to the Polar Surface Water (PSW) which is an addition to the ligand exported from the central Arctic to Fram Strait. The significant differences (in terms of LCu and log Kcond Cu2+L) between shelf and coastal samples were explained considering the processes which modify ligand concentrations and binding strengths, such as biological activity in sea-ice, phytoplankton bloom in surface waters, bacterial degradation, and meltwater discharge from 79NG glacier terminus. Overall, the ligand concentration exceeded those of dissolved Cu (dCu) and kept the free copper (Cu2+) concentrations at femtomolar levels (0.13-21.13 fM). This indicates that Cu2+ toxicity limits were not reached and dCu levels were stabilized in surface waters by organic complexes, which favoured its transport to the Nordic Seas and North Atlantic Ocean and the development of microorganism.",2024,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,909,,,WOS:001146811900001,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168162,,#6,Arnone 2024,,Cu environmental chemistry; biota; primary source
"Geochemistry and distribution of Metals in the Sediments of Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, Arctic","Sagar, MKV; Kannan, VM; Gopikrishna, VG; Krishnan, KP; Mohan, M","The arctic regions are facing serious environmental threats related to global warming. The marine geochemistry and metal sequestration in the marine sediments imply the present as well as past cli-matic conditions and elemental distribution, along with its dynamics. Various geochemical parameters were measured in the twelve sediment samples from Kongsfjorden. These were dominated by sand in the inner fjord and clay in the outer fjord area. The geochemical parameters such as organic carbon (OC) (mean 1.29%), inorganic carbon (CaCO3) (mean 10.16%), total nitrogen (TN) (mean 0.19%) and total phosphorus (TP) (mean 0.08%) show higher concentrations in the surface sediments of outer fjord regions. The concentrations of heavy metals are higher in the outer fjord regions and lower in the inner fjord regions. The various sediment quality-based indices analyses, such as the Enrichment Factor (EF) and geo-accumulation index, revealed high enrichment of heavy metals like Cu, Pb, Zn in the Kongsfjorden region, which is exposed to impending pollution from various sources. The modified PERI index values indicated that outer fjord region was under the level of considerable risk. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Recolonization and recovery of an Arctic benthic community subject to mine-tailings deposits,"Trannum, HC; Pedersen, KB; Renaud, PE; Christensen, GN; Evenset, A","Deposition of large volumes of mine tailings takes place in several Norwegian fjords, but the impacts on marine ecosystems have received relatively little scientific attention. At a 40 + -year old tailing deposition area for a copper mine in the Arctic fjord Repparfjorden, we investigated both short-term colonization of mine tailings-contaminated sediments through a field experiment, and the present faunal state in the old deposit area. Copper-concentrations at the old deposition site were still high (up to 291 mg/kg dry weight (dw)), and exceeded the Norwegian environmental-quality threshold (84 mg/kg dw). Furthermore, copper was identified as a sig-nificant structuring factor for the fauna in the fjord, although faunal diversity was relatively high and the community not severely disturbed. In the colonization experiment, experimental boxes filled with defaunated sediment capped with mine tailings were subject to colonization for 15 months. Benthic macrofaunal commu-nities were successfully established in all boxes, but the boxes with tailings showed lower species richness, abundance and biomass than the controls. Mine tailings continue to have local impacts on seafloor communities decades after deposition, and even low levels of metal-rich sediments can affect faunal recruitment. These results have implications for submarine deposition of mining waste and the impacts they have on coastal ecosystems.",2023,,JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH,191,,,WOS:000916929400001,10.1016/j.seares.2022.102327,,#10,Trannum 2023,,biota; marine; primary source; sediment
The Transpolar Drift as a Source of Riverine and Shelf-Derived Trace Elements to the Central Arctic Ocean,"Charette, MA; Kipp, LE; Jensen, LT; Dabrowski, JS; Whitmore, LM; Fitzsimmons, JN; Williford, T; Ulfsbo, A; Jones, E; Bundy, RM; Vivancos, SM; Pahnke, K; John, SG; Xiang, Y; Hatta, M; Petrova, M; Heimbürger-Boavida, L; Bauch, D; Newton, R; Pasqualini, A; Agather, AM; Amon, RMW; Anderson, RF; Andersson, PS; Benner, R; Bowman, KL; Edwards, RL; Gdaniec, S; Gerringa, LJA; González, AG; Granskog, M; Haley, B; Hammerschmidt, CR; Hansell, DA; Henderson, PB; Kadko, DC; Kaiser, K; Laan, P; Lam, PJ; Lamborg, CH; Levier, M; Li, XL; Margolin, AR; Measures, C; Middag, R; Millero, FJ; Moore, WS; Paffrath, R; Planquette, H; Rabe, B; Reader, H; Rember, R; Rijkenberg, MJA; Roy-Barman, M; van der Loeff, MR; Saito, M; Schauer, U; Schlosser, P; Sherrell, RM; Shiller, AM; Slagter, H; Sonke, JE; Stedmon, C; Woosley, RJ; Valk, O; van Ooijen, J; Zhang, RF","A major surface circulation feature of the Arctic Ocean is the Transpolar Drift (TPD), a current that transports river-influenced shelf water from the Laptev and East Siberian Seas toward the center of the basin and Fram Strait. In 2015, the international GEOTRACES program included a high-resolution pan-Arctic survey of carbon, nutrients, and a suite of trace elements and isotopes (TEIs). The cruises bisected the TPD at two locations in the central basin, which were defined by maxima in meteoric water and dissolved organic carbon concentrations that spanned 600 km horizontally and similar to 25-50 m vertically. Dissolved TEIs such as Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Hg, Nd, and Th, which are generally particle-reactive but can be complexed by organic matter, were observed at concentrations much higher than expected for the open ocean setting. Other trace element concentrations such as Al, V, Ga, and Pb were lower than expected due to scavenging over the productive East Siberian and Laptev shelf seas. Using a combination of radionuclide tracers and ice drift modeling, the transport rate for the core of the TPD was estimated at 0.9 +/- 0.4 Sv (10(6) m(3)s(-1)). This rate was used to derive the mass flux for TEIs that were enriched in the TPD, revealing the importance of lateral transport in supplying materials beneath the ice to the central Arctic Ocean and potentially to the North Atlantic Ocean via Fram Strait. Continued intensification of the Arctic hydrologic cycle and permafrost degradation will likely lead to an increase in the flux of TEIs into the Arctic Ocean.Plain Language Summary A major feature of the Arctic Ocean circulation is the Transpolar Drift (TPD), a surface current that carries ice and continental shelf-derived materials from Siberia across the North Pole to the North Atlantic Ocean. In 2015, an international team of oceanographers conducted a survey of trace elements in the Arctic Ocean, traversing the TPD. Near the North Pole, they observed much higher concentrations of trace elements in surface waters than in regions on either side of the current. These trace elements originated from land, and their journey across the Arctic Ocean is made possible by chemical reactions with dissolved organic matter that originates mainly in Arctic rivers. This study reveals the importance of rivers and shelf processes combined with strong ocean currents in supplying trace elements to the central Arctic Ocean and onward to the Atlantic. These trace element inputs are expected to increase as a result of permafrost thawing and increased river runoff in the Arctic, which is warming at a rate much faster than anywhere else on Earth. Since many of the trace elements are essential building blocks for ocean life, these processes could lead to significant changes in the marine ecosystems and fisheries of the Arctic Ocean.",2020,,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,125,5,,WOS:000548601000017,10.1029/2019JC015920,,#12,Charette 2020,,Cu environmental chemistry; freshwater; marine; primary source
"History of heavy metal accumulation in the Svalbard area: Distribution, origin and transport pathways","Zaborska, A; Beszczynska-Möller, A; Wlodarska-Kowalczuk, M","In this study temporal changes of Pb, Zn, Cd and Cu concentrations were studied in 19 dated sediment cores collected from Svalbard fjords and the Barents Sea. The main aim was to study spatial and historical variations in heavy metal concentrations, deposition rates and sources in the context of different metal transport pathways. Metal concentrations ranged from 5.7 to 45.8 mg kg(-1) for Pb, from 13.4 to 54.5 mg kg(-1) for Cu, from 0.01 to 0.90 mg kg(-1) for Cd and from 55.6 to 130.4 mg kg(-1) for Zn. Some fjords were unpolluted by heavy metals while in others a clear signal of metal enrichment was found (outer Kongsfjorden, Hornsund, Adventfjorden). Large-scale processes such as atmospheric and oceanic transport were found to be important drivers of heavy metal contaminant distribution. The significance of global drivers varied among the fjords, due to coupling with local processes. Outer fjord parts, the most impacted by oceanic transport, were characterized by the excess Pb-206/Pb-207 values of similar to 1.17, while the inner basins were characterized by the excess (206)pb/Pb-207 of similar to 1.14 suggesting possible different importance of Pb sources (marine currents and atmospheric transport).

"Anthropogenic and natural sources of particulate trace elements in the coastal marine environment of Kongsfjorden, Svalbard","Bazzano, A; Rivaro, P; Soggia, F; Ardini, F; Grotti, M","Suspended particulate matter collected from the coastal marine environment of Kongsflorden (Svalbard Islands, Norwegian Arctic) has been investigated in order to determine its elemental composition and to assess the natural and anthropogenic sources of particulate trace elements. For this purpose, two surveys were carried out in June and September 2012, measuring hydrographic, biological and chemical parameters along the water column at representative sites. The sources of trace elements were evaluated by measuring (208)pb/(207)pb and (206)pb/(207)pb isotope ratios and comparing them with the isotopic signature of the atmospheric particulate and marine sediments collected in the same area.It was found that natural input from the glaciers is the major source for Al, Co, Fe, K, Ti and V, whereas Ba, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb and Zn of anthropogenic origin are mainly introduced into the fjord through the intrusion of Atlantic waters. The influence of the glacial runoff decreased with the distance from the front and it was higher at the end of the summer season than in late spring. On the other hand, the effect of the Atlantic waters was more relevant in the bottom layer at the entrance of the fjord, especially during the summer season. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"The impact of submarine copper mine tailing disposal from the 1970s on Repparfjorden, northern Norway","Sternal, B; Junttila, J; Skirbekk, K; Forwick, M; Carroll, J; Pedersen, KB","We investigate the state of sedimentological environment and contaminant status of Repparfjorden (N Norway) impacted by submarine disposal of mine tailings during the 1970s using sedimentological and geochemical properties of seventeen sediment cores. The impact of tailings disposal is mainly restricted to the inner fjord where the discharge occurred. Sediment cores retrieved from the inner fjord contain layers of mine tailings up to 9-cm thick, 3-9 cm below the seafloor. Spreading of the tailing-related metal Cu and particles is limited to the inner fjord and to a 2 cm layer in one core from the outer fjord. Two interrelated factors, fjord morphology and sedimentation rate, controlled the distribution of contaminant-laden tailings in the fjord. The mobility of Cu from buried contaminated sediments to the sediment-water interface in the inner fjord indicates that benthic communities have been continuously exposed to elevated Cu concentrations for nearly four decades.",2017,,MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN,120,01-Feb,136-153,WOS:000407539300027,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.04.054,,#17,Sternal 2017,,marine; primary source; sediment
Animal excrement: A potential biomonitor of heavy metal contamination in the marine environment,"Yin, XB; Xia, LJ; Sun, LG; Luo, HH; Wang, YH","To assess the feasibility of using animal excrement to biomonitor the extent of heavy metal contamination in the marine environment, concentrations of mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in the fresh excrement of seabirds and marine mammals, along with other biomaterials, from the Arctic, Antarctica (West and East), and Xisha Archipelago of the South China Sea were determined. Results show that the excrement of marine animals at higher trophic levels generally contained high levels of Hg, demonstrating the biomagnification of Hg through food chains in different remote regions. Significant variations in metal accumulation in the excrements were observed among the distinctive geographical areas, with the highest Hg concentration in Xisha Archipelago and the highest Pb concentration in the Arctic, which reflects different levels of air metal pollution at various sampling locations. Concentrations of Cu in the excrements primarily correlate to the geochemical background levels in the regions. High Cu concentrations were found near the Great Wall Station in West Antarctica where a copper mineralized belt exists. No clear spatial variation pattern was found for Zn accumulation in the excrement. This study shows that animal excrement can be used as bioindicators for the level of metal contamination in the marine environment, with the advantages of easy sampling, accurate detection (i.e., with high levels of metal accumulation), and reconstructing historical metal contamination trends by long-term monitoring of sedimentary excrements.

"Source, mobility, and bioavailability of metals in fjord sediments of Krossfjord-Kongsfjord system, Arctic, Svalbard","Choudhary, S; Nayak, GN; Khare, N","Krossfjord-Kongsfjord system situated on the west coast of Svalbard archipelago is an ideal location to investigate the impacts of climate change on the environment. As a consequence of global warming, metal concentrations in the Arctic region are increasing due to permafrost melting and changes in biological processes. Therefore, the fjord sediments were studied for identification of provenance, mobility, bioavailability, and potential toxicity of metals in the fjord environment. Finer sediments and organic matter were found to be higher away from the glacier outlets, while coarser sediments were found to be higher near the glacier head. Illite, kaolinite, and chlorite constituted the clay mineral assemblage which had slightly influenced the metal distributions. The variations in metal abundance were attributed largely to the glacial activity along with the influence of Atlantic water mass in western Spitsbergen. Fjord system received sediment from the weathering of rocks indicating an input of terrigenous material. Comparison of metals in bulk sediment with Arctic sediment quality guidelines (ASQGs) showed that Zn and Cu were enriched in the sediment. However, to avoid the overestimation of the risk associated, fractionation of the metals was carried out which revealed higher Mn and Co in labile phases that pose a considerable risk to the biota.",2020,,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,27,13,15130-15148,WOS:000516241100001,10.1007/s11356-020-07879-1,,#20,Choudhary 2020,,marine; primary source; sediment
Fate of trace elements and emerging environmental pollutants (benzotriazoles and benzothiazoles) from a glacier-fed river in the mixing zone of an Arctic fjord system,"Amey, J; Mikkelsen, O","The fate of organic and inorganic pollutants was studied in the Arctic, in the mixing zone of freshwater and seawater of a glacier-fed river and a fjord (Ny-& Aring;lesund, Svalbard). Concentrations of trace elements and contaminants of emerging concern, benzotriazoles and benzothiazoles (BTRs and BTHs), were assessed. Metal concentrations of Al, As, Cr, Hg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, V, and Zn in marine sediment were up to two or three times higher than in riverine sediment and most of them showed an increasing trend from the upper to the lower part of the river. Pb (0.058 mu g/L) and Zn (0.80 mu g/L) were present in levels of moderate pollution in seawater close to town, while Cu (0.11 mu g/L) exceeded background levels in the same area. As (0.042 mu g/L), Hg (0.004 mu g/L) and Cd (0.011 mu g/L) showed levels of low to moderate pollution in freshwater from the river. In seawater and river water detected BTRs and BTHs were: BTR, TTR, 2-OH-BTH, XTR, 2-Me-S-BTH, 2-M-BTH, 2-S-BTH, and 2-NH2- BTH. Considerably high concentrations of BTR (1460 ng/L) and 2-OH-BTH (1070 ng/L) were found. Compounds present in marine and riverine sediment were BTR, 2-OH-BTH, 2-Me-S-BTH, and 2-M-BTH.

Heavy metals in fish from the Barents Sea in (summer 1994),"Zauke, GP; Savinov, VM; Ritterhoff, J; Savinova, T","To assess the significance of metals in biota of the Barents Sea, preliminary information is presented for the concentrations of Cd, Pb, Hg, Ni, Cu and Zn in liver and muscle tissues of 15 marine fish species collected in the summer of 1994. Lead and Ni concentrations are below limits of detection (< 0.3 and 1.0 mg kg(-1) dry wt.) in all tissues, as is Cd in muscle (< 0.10 mg kg(-1)). Generally, most of our results are within the reported literature range for various Arctic marine systems, especially regarding some commercially important species like cod and redfish, indicating that metal levels are not elevated. However, the interspecific variability is substantial and some remarkably high Cd levels (2.4 and 8.1 mg kg(-1) dry wt.) in livers of Anarhichas species (catfish) and Raja fyllae (round skate) point to the problem of a general 'cadmium-anomaly' in polar marine waters, previously inferred from reported results for various pelagic and benthic invertebrates.

"Concentrations, provenance and flux of aerosol trace elements during US GEOTRACES Western Arctic cruise GN01","Marsay, CM; Kadko, D; Landing, WM; Morton, PL; Summers, BA; Buck, CS","The Arctic region is undergoing significant changes in climate, with a notable decrease in summertime sea ice coverage over the past three decades. This trend means an increasing proportion of Arctic Ocean surface waters can receive direct deposition of material from the atmosphere, potentially influencing marine biogeochemical cycles and delivery of pollutants to the Arctic ecosystem. Here, we present aerosol concentrations of selected trace elements (Al, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) measured during the US GEOTRACES Western Arctic cruise (GN01, also known as HLY1502) in August-October 2015. Concentrations of ""lithogenic"" elements (Al, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, and Co) were similar to those measured in remote and predominantly marine-influenced air masses in previous studies, reflecting the remoteness of the Arctic Ocean from major dust sources. Concentrations of Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd showed significant enrichments over crustal values, and were often of similar magnitude to concentrations measured over the North Atlantic in air masses of North American or European provenance. We use Be-7 inventory and flux data from GN01 to estimate a bulk atmospheric deposition velocity during the study period, and combine it with our aerosol concentrations to calculate atmospheric deposition fluxes of the trace elements in the Arctic region during late summer.

"Trace Element (Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) Dynamics Across the Salinity Gradient in Arctic and Antarctic Glacier Fjords","Krause, J; Hopwood, MJ; Höfer, J; Krisch, S; Achterberg, EP; Alarcón, E; Carroll, D; González, HE; Juul-Pedersen, T; Liu, T; Lodeiro, P; Meire, L; Rosing, MT","Around the Greenlandic and Antarctic coastlines, sediment plumes associated with glaciers are significant sources of lithogenic material to the ocean. These plumes contain elevated concentrations of a range of trace metals, especially in particle bound phases, but it is not clear how these particles affect dissolved (< 0.2 mu m) metal distributions in the ocean. Here we show, using transects in 8 glacier fjords, trends in the distribution of dissolved iron, cobalt, nickel and copper (dFe, dCo, dNi, dCu). Following rapid dFe loss close to glacier outflows, dFe concentrations in particular showed strong similarities between different fjords. Similar dFe concentrations were also observed between seasons/years when Nuup Kangerlua (SW Greenland) was revisited in spring, mid- and late-summer. Dissolved Cu, dCo and dNi concentrations were more variable and showed different gradients with salinity depending on the fjord, season and year. The lack of consistent trends for dCu and dNi largely reflects less pronounced differences contrasting the concentration of inflowing shelf waters with fresher glacially-modified waters. Particles also made only small contributions to total dissolvable Cu (dCu constituted 83 +/- 28% of total dissolvable Cu) and Ni (dNi constituted 86 +/- 28% of total dissolvable Ni) within glacier plumes. For comparison, dFe was a lower fraction of total dissolvable Fe; 3.5 +/- 4.8%. High concentrations of total dissolvable Fe in some inner-fjord environments, up to 77 mu M in Ameralik (SW Greenland), may drive enhanced removal of scavenged type elements, such as Co. Further variability may have been driven by local bedrock mineralogy, which could explain high concentrations of dNi (25-29 nM) and dCo (6-7 nM) in one coastal region of west Greenland (Kangaatsiaq). Our results suggest that dissolved trace element distributions in glacier fjords are influenced by a range of factors including: freshwater concentrations, local geology, drawdown by scavenging and primary production, saline inflow, and sediment dynamics. Considering the lack of apparent seasonality in dFe concentrations, we suggest that fluxes of some trace elements may scale proportionately to fjord overturning rather than directly to freshwater discharge flux.",2021,,FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,9,,,WOS:000707465500001,10.3389/feart.2021.725279,,#27,Krause 2021,,Cu environmental chemistry; marine
"Sources, fate and distribution of inorganic contaminants in the Svalbard area, representative of a typical Arctic critical environment-a review","Rudnicka-Kepa, P; Zaborska, A","Global environmental changes not only contribute to the modification of global pollution transport pathways but can also alter contaminant fate within the Arctic. Recent reports underline the importance of secondary sources of pollution, e.g. melting glaciers, thawing permafrost or increased riverine run-off. This article reviews reports on the European Arctic-we concentrate on the Svalbard region-and environmental contamination by inorganic pollutants (heavy metals and artificial radionuclides), including their transport pathways, their fate in the Arctic environment and the concentrations of individual elements in the ecosystem. This review presents in detail the secondary contaminant sources and tries to identify knowledge gaps, as well as indicate needs for further research. Concentrations of heavy metals and radionuclides in Svalbard have been studied, in various environmental elements since the beginning of the twentieth century. In the last 5 years, the highest concentrations of Cd (13 mg kg(-1)) and As (28 mg kg(-1)) were recorded for organic-rich soils, while levels of Pb (99 mg kg(-1)), Hg (1 mg kg(-1)), Zn (496 mg kg(-1)) and Cu (688 mg kg(-1)) were recorded for marine sediments. Increased heavy metal concentrations were also recorded in some flora and fauna species. For radionuclides in the last 5 years, the highest concentrations of Cs-137 (4500 Bq kg(-1)), Pu-238 (2 Bq kg(-1)) and Pu239 + 240 (43 Bq kg(-1)) were recorded for cryoconites, and the highest concentration of Am-241 (570 Bq kg(-1)) was recorded in surface sediments. However, no contamination of flora and fauna with radionuclides was observed.",2021,,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,193,11,,WOS:000707362000003,10.1007/s10661-021-09305-6,,#30,Rudnicka-Kepa 2021,,biota; marine; non-primary source; sediment; terrestrial
Regional and species specific bioaccumulation of major and trace elements in Arctic seabirds,"Borgå, K; Campbell, L; Gabrielsen, GW; Norstrom, RJ; Muir, DCG; Fisk, AT","Twenty-five essential and nonessential elements were analyzed in Arctic seabirds to study the influence of phylogeny, tissue, Arctic region, and diet on avian element accumulation and to identify co-occurrence among metals. Muscle and liver concentrations were positively correlated, generally being higher in liver than in muscle, and generally did not differ by sex. Zinc showed the highest absolute concentrations in all samples (mean, 11.2-26.7 mu g/g in muscle, depending on species and area), followed by copper (5.2-7.5 mu g/g), arsenic (0.5-5.4 mu g/g), selenium (1.0-5.8 mu g/g), rubidium (1.4-2.2 mu g/g), and cadmium (0.04-1.2 mu g/g). Mercury levels ranged from 0.05 to 0.8 mu g/g in muscle. The concentrations varied among species (dovekie (Alle alle], black guillemot [Cepphus grylle], thick-billed murre [Uria lomvia], black-legged kittiwake [Rissa tridactyla], northern fulmar [Fulmaris glacialis], ivory gull [Pagophila eburnean], Thayer's gull [Larus thayeri], and glaucous gull [Larus hyperboreus]), and between the northern Baffin Bay (Canada) and the Barents Sea, depending on the element. Whereas some elements (e.g., mercury and zinc) increased in absolute and standardized concentrations with trophic level in the northern Baffin Bay, most elements showed no relationship with trophic level or other dietary descriptors. In absolute concentrations, nonessential elements differed between regions, whereas essential elements differed among species but not within a species across the two regions. Standardized concentrations (element pattern) of both essential elements and nonessential elements generally did not differ between regions but was highly species specific and, thus, determined by the phylogenetic element regulation capacity. The usefulness of multivariate ordination in element wildlife studies is illustrated, which provides additional insight regarding element co-occurrence in wildlife, allows inclusion of species with low sample number, and reduces the possibility of type II1 errors created by low sample size.",2006,,ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,25,11,2927-2936,WOS:000241308900016,10.1897/05-574R1.1,,#34,Borgå 2006,,Cu biology; biota; marine; pre-2010; primary source
Assessment of metal concentrations found within a North Sea drill cuttings pile,"Breuer, E; Shimmield, G; Peppe, O","North Sea drill cuttings piles are a distinct anthropogenic legacy resulting from the exploration and production of North Sea oil reserves.

"Ecological risk assessment of metals in the Arctic environment with emphasis on Kongsfjorden Fjord and freshwater lakes of Ny-Alesund, Svalbard","Rajaram, R; Ganeshkumar, A; Charles, PE","The concentrations of five heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn) in the sediments, water, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and macroalgae from Kongsfjorden Fjord and the freshwater lakes of Ny-Alesund in the Svalbard archipelago were determined in order to describe the anthropogenic impacts related to the Ny-Alesund town. Water samples from nine stations, sediment samples from 23 stations, plankton samples from five stations, and six species of macroalgae were collected and subjected to heavy metal analysis using atomic absorption spec-trophotometry (AAS). Only Cu and Zn were detected in the water samples. The plankton samples had only Zn, Cu, and Cr. The average metal concentrations in macroalgae fell in the decreasing order of Cu > Zn > Cr > Cd > Pb. In sediment samples, the metal order was as follows: Zn > Cu > Cr > Pb > Cd. Multivariate statistical an-alyses including principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were used to identify the source of the metal contamination. The metals were found to originate from a blend of both anthropogenic and geogenic sources. Pollution monitoring indices including geoaccumulation index (Igeo), contamination factor, contamination degree (Cdeg), pollution load index (PLI), and potential ecological risk (PER) were calculated using the metal data. In the study area, Igeo values of the metals showed pollution grades from 0 (uncontaminated) to 6 (extremely contaminated). Cdeg fell in classes from 1 (low contamination) to 4 (very high contamination). PLI values ranged between 0 and 5.68. PER values expressed that except for a few stations located at higher elevations in the glacial outwash plains, all other sites were highly polluted. The high level of pollution indices in the sites can be attributed to the anthropogenic activities persistent in the study area.",2023,,CHEMOSPHERE,310,,,WOS:000916182400005,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.136737,,#37,Rajaram 2023,,marine; primary source; sediment

Enhanced heavy metal discharges to marine deposits in glacial bays of two Arctic fjords (Hornsund and Kongsfjorden),"Rudnicka-Kepa, P; Beldowska, M; Zaborska, A","Climate change is transforming Arctic ecosystems in ways that are influencing the transport and accumulation of contaminants. The spatial and temporal variability of heavy metal distribution was studied in two Spitsbergen fjords - Kongsfjorden and Hornsund. Sediment cores from five stations in Kongsfjorden and six in Hornsund were collected in 2018-2019 and used for measurement of heavy metal concentrations (Hg, Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn). Sediment layers were dated by the 210Pb method to reveal the history of contamination. Isotopic lead compo-sition was used to study sources of Pb. Loads of heavy metals to fjord deposits were calculated based on mass sediment accumulation rates. The heavy metal loads varied spatially and reached ranged 0.3 mg m- 2 yr-1 for Hg, 57.6 mg m- 2 yr-1 for Pb, 0.5 mg m- 2 yr-1 for Cd, 101 mg m- 2 yr-1 for Cu, and 117 mg m- 2 yr-1 for Zn.

Long-term dispersion and availability of metals from submarine mine tailing disposal in a fjord in Arctic Norway,"Pedersen, KB; Jensen, PE; Sternal, B; Ottosen, LM; Henning, MV; Kudahl, MM; Junttila, J; Skirbekk, K; Frantzen, M","Mining of Cu took place in Kvalsund in the Arctic part of Norway in the 1970s, and mine tailings were discharged to the inner part of the fjord, Repparfjorden. Metal speciation analysis was used to assess the historical dispersion of metals as well as their potential bioavailability from the area of the mine tailing disposal. It was revealed that the dispersion of Ba, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn from the mine tailings has been limited. Dispersion of Cu to the outer fjord has, however, occurred; the amounts released and dispersed from the mine tailing disposal area quantified to be 2.5-10t, less than 5% of Cu in the original mine tailings. An estimated 80-390t of Cu still remains in the disposal area from the surface to a depth of 16cm. Metal partitioning showed that 56-95% of the Cu is bound in the potential bioavailable fractions (exchangeable, reducible and oxidisable) of the sediments, totalling approximately 70-340t, with potential for continuous release to the pore water and re-precipitation in over- and underlying sediments. Surface sediments in the deposit area were affected by elevated Cu concentrations just above the probable effect level according to the Norwegian sediment quality criteria, with 50-80% Cu bound in the exchangeable, reducible and oxidisable fractions, potentially available for release to the water column and/or for uptake in benthic organisms.",2018,,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,25,33,32901-32912,WOS:000449920100009,10.1007/s11356-017-9276-y,,#45,Pedersen 2018,,Cu environmental chemistry; marine; primary source; sediment

The endangered Baltic Sea population of eiders was demonstrably affected by element pollution in the 1990s. While blood concentrations of Hg were higher in Baltic breeding eiders, blood Se, As and Cd concentrations were higher in Arctic eiders. Blood concentrations of Pb, Cr, Zn and Cu did not differ between the two populations. While blood Pb concentrations had declined in Baltic eiders since the 1990s, Hg concentrations had not declined, and were above concentrations associated with adverse oxidative effects in other bird species. Inconsistent with blood concentrations, feather concentrations suggested that Pb, Zn, and Cd exposure was higher in Baltic eiders, and that Hg exposure was higher in Arctic eiders.

Heavy metals in the atmospheric precipitation on the Barents Sea coast,"Golubeva, NI; Burtseva, LV; Ginzburg, VA",The results of heavy metal measurements in monthly precipitation samples are analyzed at biological station Dal'nie Zelentsy to define the role of the atmospheric precipitation in the marine environment pollution in the Barents Sea coastal region. Peculiarities of the atmospheric processes and the genesis of air masses bringing the precipitation and the extent of their effect on the precipitation pollution with heavy metals are considered based on the data obtained in 2001-2002. Of the air masses brining the precipitation to the Kola Peninsula coast the air masses of a marine origin have significant advantage. It is shown that weight average heavy metal (except copper) concentrations in the precipitation from the marine air masses on the Kola coast are higher than in the precipitation from the continental air masses.

The high concentration of elements including Sr, As, and Zn indicated anthropogenic contribution and may affect the fish community in the fragile ecosystem of the High Arctic. The movement of tourists and logistics must be regulated to prevent serious change in Svalbard.

Lability of toxic elements in Submarine Tailings Disposal: The relationship between metal fractionation and metal uptake by sandworms (Alitta virens),"Simonsen, AMT; Pedersen, KB; Jensen, PE; Elberling, B; Bach, L","Mine tailings from the iron ore mine Sydvaranger Gruve have been deposited in Bokfjorden, Northern Norway, for >40 years. This study investigates the environmental impacts of submarine tailings disposal one year after the cessation of the mine by combining analyses of total metal concentrations (nitric acid digestion) and metal fractionation patterns (sequential extraction procedure) of sediments with the metal uptake (bioassays) by sandworms (Alitta virens) exposed to Bokfjorden sediment. The analyses focused on metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Zn) in sediment cores retrieved from a horizontal transect of the fjord. High concentrations of the target metal iron was found in the fjord (N13,000 mg/kg). According to Norwegian sediment quality guidelines (SQG), cadmium (2.55 mg/kg) and lead (174 mg/kg) were the only metals to exceed good sediment quality at the source area ofmine tailings discharge. Despite general low total metal concentrations, labile (summarized exchangeable, acid soluble, reducible fractions) and potentially labile (summarized labile and oxidisable fractions) pools of mine tailings-related metals of cadmium (10-82%), copper (25-88%) and lead (10-67%) were detected while iron were characterized as inert (residual fraction: 89-97%). Despite spatial trends in total metal concentrations presumed to originate from mine tailings (Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb), there were no correlations between total and labile fractions. This can be explained by the high concentrations of iron, which under oxidised forms are suggested to inhibit a high lability of other metals. The metal uptake of sandworms was generally high compared to similar studies and exceeded moderate contamination classes for all metals compared to Norwegian standard values. Both labile metal fractions (cadmium, copper and iron) and total metal concentrations (copper, iron) showed positive correlations (r > 0.6) with metal uptake. Thus, both the total and labile metal fractions can pose an environmental risk. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

"Temporal isolation between two strongly differentiated stocks of the Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides Walbaum, 1792) from the Western Barents Sea","Wojtasik, B; Kijewska, A; Mioduchowska, M; Mikula, B; Sell, J","Identification of discrete stocks of Greenland halibut is an important aspect of proper fisheries exploitation. Available literature data indicated a lack of significant inter-area differences between Greenland halibut populations from the Northeast Atlantic. To define the population diversity, two aspects were taken into account: enzyme-genetic diversity and the concentration of heavy metals in tissues. Seven allozyme loci variations were used to characterize the genetic structure of four populations of Greenland halibut from the Western Barents Sea region. The samples were collected from the spawning area in the period when this species took migration to spawn. The sample RH4 was significantly different from the other samples collected from the same location (RH2 and RH3) and depth for over two days. Another sample (RH8), collected from the nearby area 6 days later was similar to the samples RH2, RH3. We noticed a significant divergence between the sample RH4 and the three remaining samples, where the value of the index FST fluctuated about 0.40 and approximately 0.01 between three similar populations. This genetic fluctuation negates the thesis of a panmictic character of the Western Atlantic population.Feeding groups of Greenland halibut are moving along the Barents Sea shelf and they are exposed to different heavy metals concentrations according to the food preferences or the exact place of feeding. We identified similar concentrations of heavy metals, i.e., Zn, Cu, Cd, and Pb in all samples.

Environmental heterogeneity mediated prokaryotic community variations in marine sediments,"Sun, JX; Zhou, HB; Cheng, HA; Chen, Z; Wang, YG","Marine ecosystems have been heavily affected by environmental changes, which led to shift of prokaryotic diversity and distribution, especially in the Arctic Ocean. However, how environmental changes affect prokaryotic community still unclear. Here, prokaryotic diversity, community composition and spatial distribution patterns in marine sediments from the Bering Sea to the western Arctic Ocean were surveyed. The results indicated that the lowest bacterial and archaeal diversities were observed in the western Arctic Ocean. Moreover, the prokaryotic richness and diversity showed strong correlation (R 2 = 0.31 similar to 0.83, P < 0.05) with heavy metals (such as Cu, Zn, Ni and As). The contents of Ni and As repre-sented a range with in which biological effects occur occasionally in the Bering Strait, but concentrations of Cu, Zn, Ni and As in the western Arctic Ocean showed a probable effect range with in which adverse biological effects occasionally or frequently occur. Further-more, as geographical distance increased archaeal community similarity decreased faster than bacteria. The abundances of Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes and Thaumarchaeota significantly increased from the Bering Sea to the western Arctic Ocean. Conversely, much lower abundances of Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Crenarchaeota were observed in the western Arctic Ocean. In addition, all environmental could explain 73.8% and 85.1% bacterial and archaeal variations, respectively. And heavy metals could independently ex-plain 40.3% and 30.4% community variation for archaea and bacteria, respectively.

Trace metal signatures of Jurassic/Cretaceous black shales from the Norwegian Shelf and the Barents Sea,"Lipinski, M; Warning, B; Brumsack, HJ","Black shale samples of Jurassic to Cretaceous age recovered during the 'Norwegian Shelf Drilling Program' between 1987 and 1991 from Sites 7430/10-U-01 (Barents Sea), 6814/04-U-02 (Norwegian Shelf near the Lofoten) and 6307/07-U-02 (Norwegian Shelf near Trondheim) were analyzed for major and trace elements. These laminated black shales are characterized by high total organic carbon (TOC) and total sulfur (TS) contents as well as by significant enrichments in several redox-sensitive and/or sulfide-forming trace metals (Ag, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Re, Sb, Tl, U, V, and Zn). Enrichment factors relative to 'average shale' are comparable to those found in Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event (CTBE) black shales and Mediterranean sapropels. The Re content is high in the studied black shales, with maximum values up to 1221 ng/g. Re/Mo ratios averaging 2.3 x 10(-3) are close to the seawater value. High trace metal enrichments and Re/Mo ratios close to the seawater value point to a dominantly anoxic and sulfidic water column during black shale formation. Interbeds with higher Re/Mo ratios, especially in high-resolution sampled core sections, point to brief periods of suboxic conditions. Additionally, enhanced Zn concentrations in the black shales from the Barents Sea support the assumption that hydrothermal activity was also high during black shale deposition. Trace metal signatures of black shales at different drill sites on a transect along the Norwegian Shelf are not only influenced by water depth but also by their location in the boreal realm. Metal enrichments are higher in the northern compared to the southern sites. Volgian (=Tithonian 151-144 Ma BP) black shales exhibit elevated trace metal contents in comparison to their Berriasian (144-137 Ma BP) counterparts. This probably reflects a change in the circulation pattern during periods of black shale formation. Therefore different paleoceanographic conditions, probably controlled by climatic change linked to the transgression of the paleo-sealevel and the North Atlantic opening, may have developed from the Volgian to the Berriasian.

During melt pond formation and development, micronutrient and contaminant trace elements (TEs) from seasonally accumulated atmospheric deposition are mixed with entrained sedimentary and marine-derived material before being released to the surface ocean during sea ice melting. Here we present particulate and size-fractionated dissolved (truly soluble and colloidal) TE data from five melt ponds sampled in late summer 2015, during the US Arctic GEOTRACES (GN01) cruise. Analyses of salinity, delta O-18, and Be-7 indicate variable contributions to the melt ponds from snowmelt, melting sea ice, and surface seawater. Our data highlight the complex TE biogeochemistry of late summer Arctic melt ponds and the variable importance of different sources for specific TEs. Dissolved TE concentrations indicate a strong influence from seawater intrusion for V, Ni, Cu, Cd, and Ba. Ultrafiltration methods reveal dissolved Fe, Zn, and Pb to be mostly colloidal (0.003-0.2 mu m), while Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, and Cd are dominated by a truly soluble ( < 0.003 mu m) fraction. Isotopically light dissolved Fe in some melt ponds suggests that photochemical and/or biologically driven redox cycling also takes place. Comparisons of particulate TE/Al ratios to mean crustal values indicate influences from lithogenic sources, including natural aerosols and/or sedimentary material, with significant enrichments for some elements, including Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb, that may result from anthropogenic aerosols, biogenic material, and/or in situ scavenging of dissolved TEs. Our results indicate that melt ponds represent a transitional environment in which some atmospherically-derived TEs undergo physical and/or chemical changes before their release to the surface ocean. As a result, the ongoing changes in sea ice areal extent, thickness, and melt season length are likely to influence the bioavailability of atmospheric TE input to the surface Arctic Ocean, with material released from snow and sea ice via melt ponds earlier in the summer and with more extensive direct deposition to the ocean surface.",2018,,MARINE CHEMISTRY,204,,70-85,WOS:000443668500007,10.1016/j.marchem.2018.06.002,,#69,Marsay 2018,,freshwater; terrestrial
Temporal trends of contaminants in cod from Icelandic waters,"Sturludottir, E; Gunnlaugsdottir, H; Jorundsdottir, HO; Magnusdottir, EV; Olafsdottir, K; Stefansson, G","Contaminants have been analyzed in cod (Gadus morhua) since 1990 as part of the national monitoring program for the environmental conditions in the sea around Iceland. The aim of this study was to determine the temporal trends of persistent organic pollutants (POPs: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene (p,p'-DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), chlordanes (CHLs) and toxaphenes (Tox)) and trace elements (As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, Se and Zn) in cod over the last two decades at two different locations in the Arctic Ocean north of Iceland. The relationship between the contaminant concentrations and biological covariates was also determined. All of the POPs showed decreasing trends but the trace elements showed no clear signs of trend except arsenic which showed an increasing trend and zinc which showed a decreasing trend. The concentration of the POPs were lower or similar in the Icelandic cod compared to cod sampled in Norway, the Barents Sea and in the Baltic Sea, except for HCB which was higher in the Icelandic cod compared to the Norwegian cod. The concentration of the trace elements As, Cu, Hg and Zn were similar in the Icelandic cod compared to cod sampled in Norway and Greenland but the concentration of Cd was higher in the Icelandic cod. The inclusion of the biological covariates was found to be important for the statistical analysis. The POPs had a positive relationship with liver fat content but negative relationship with liver weight. The trace elements had a negative relationship with liver fat and liver weight except As which had positive relationship with liver weight Only positive relationships were observed between the contaminant concentrations and length.

Effects of the Atlantic water and glacial run-off on the spatial distribution of particulate trace elements in the Kongsfjorden,"Bazzano, A; Ardini, F; Terol, A; Rivaro, P; Soggia, F; Grotti, M","Trace elements associated to suspended particulate matter have been investigated in the marine environment of Kongsfjorden (Svalbard Islands, Norwegian Arctic), in order to provide detailed information on their spatial variability and a quantitative assessment of the natural and anthropogenic sources. During a survey in July 2014, hydrographic and biogeochemical parameters were measured in addition to trace metals along the water column at eight representative sites and the contribution of the natural and anthropogenic sources was quantified by measuring (208)pb/(207)pb and (206)pb/(207)pb isotope ratios.Al, Co, Fe, K, and V were strongly affected by glacial run-off and their content decreased moving from the inner to the outer basin. Conversely, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn were significantly enriched compared to crustal values and their concentration was higher in the outer part of the fjord. Maximum contribution for anthropogenic particulate Pb (>85%) was recorded in the upper 100 m of the water column in the outer part of the fjord. On the other hand, the contribution for terrigenous particulate Pb to surface waters was highest in the innermost station (similar to 60%), close to the glacier front, and decreased linearly (R-2 = 0.952, p-value < 0.0001) with distance from Kongsvegen terminus.

The city annually releases approximately 285,000 m(3) of untreated wastewater to the nearby Adventfjorden. To date, the environmental impact of this continuous input has been studied mainly regarding the sediments and benthic fauna in the fiord. Here, we present results from a study of raw wastewater entering Adventfjorden as well as heavy metals concentrations in the water column within the fjord itself. Two surveys were carried out in summer and autumn season 2018, to establish physical and chemical properties of water at various locations. Trace elements (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Hg, As, Cd, Pb, U), total suspended solids (TSS) and total organic carbon (TOC) were measured.

"Episodic discharge of lead, copper and antimony from a Norwegian small arm shooting range","Stromseng, AE; Ljones, M; Bakka, L; Mariussen, E","Small arm shooting ranges are major deposits of lead (Pb), copper (Cu), antimony (Sb), and zinc (Zn) from use of ammunition. Metals and metalloids from the ammunition residues may leach into the soil and surrounding watercourses and may pose a threat to exposed wildlife and humans. Discharge of elements is dependent on several factors such as soil properties, hydrological conditions, precipitation and time. In order to identify strategies to limit spread of ammunition residues from shooting ranges it is of importance to gain knowledge of the mobility of the elements from the spent bullets. Here we have monitored the levels of Pb, Cu and Sb in a small drainage stream from a Norwegian military small arm shooting range in 2001 and 2006. The first campaign in 2001 was initiated ahead of the snow-melting period in the spring and continued two months in order to quantify discharge and discharge patterns of the selected elements in the drainage stream. Two shorter campaigns were performed in autumn 2001 during an excavation, and in summer 2006. Mean levels of Pb, Cu and Sb in the stream during the first monitoring period in 2001 were 14 mu g/l, 39 mu g/l and 9 mu g/l respectively. High flow, following precipitation, led to an approximately fourfold increase in the concentration of Pb and threefold increase in the level of Cu and Sb compared to low discharge concentrations. An estimation of discharge of the metals showed that the snow melting period and precipitation events constituted to a large proportion of the total release. A sudden increase in the levels can induce more stress and reduce survival of exposed aquatic animals due to the short time available for adaptation.",2009,,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING,11,6,1259-1267,WOS:000266795900016,10.1039/b823194j,,#82,Stromseng 2009,PIERRE  BLEVIN (2025-07-20 05:05:15)(Screen): Source?; ,freshwater; pre-2010; terrestrial
Recent environmental change and human impact on Svalbard: the lake-sediment geochemical record,"Boyle, JF; Rose, NL; Appleby, PG; Birks, HJB","As part of a broader investigation into recent environmental change on Svalbard, the inorganic geochemical record of six lake-sediment cores was analysed. The major temporal trends in sediment elemental composition are driven by variations in two contrasting sediment components, both derived from catchment soils: (1) mineral matter, and (2) soil organic matter (SOM), enriched in Fe and Mn oxides and heavy metals. Two environmental impacts are recorded in most or all of the lake sediment sequences. An up-core increase in organic matter can be partly attributed to diagenetic effects, but also requires an enhanced supply of SOM relative to mineral matter. In addition, the central and southern sites all show a ca. 1970 event characterised by an enhanced mineral matter accumulation rate. This requires either an enhanced allochthonous supply or an enhanced mobilisation of littoral sediments. In either case a regional-scale driving force, such as a shift in climate, is required. At five of the lakes the sediment heavy metal concentration profiles can be explained entirely by natural factors. However, at Tenndammen (U), situated close to the Svalbard's largest settlement at Longyearbyen, possible anthropogenic Pb enrichment is found. Comparison of observed and expected heavy metal profiles (based on Greenland ice-core data) shows that the lakes are generally too insensitive to have recorded a long-transported heavy metal pollution signal.",2004,,JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY,31,4,515-530,WOS:000220602400008,10.1023/B:JOPL.0000022549.07298.6e,,#83,Boyle 2004,"Sam Welch (2025-07-18 19:01:07)(Select): Copper is in, so I'll include it. ; PIERRE  BLEVIN (2025-07-15 22:23:54)(Screen): Freshwater but can be seen as a source + need to check if Cu; ",freshwater; pre-2010; sediment
Metallothioneins in Arctic bivalves,"Amiard-Triquet, C; Rainglet, F; Larroux, C; Regoli, F; Hummel, H","In the framework of an International Association for the Promotion of Cooperation with Scientists from the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union (INTAS) Project on biodiversity and adaptation strategies of Arctic coastal marine benthos, research was focused on the role of metallothioneins as a possible indicator of the effect on animals and availability of trace metals in the Arctic. Metallothioneins are low-molecular-weight, cysteine-rich proteins known to be induced by high environmental levels of trace metals. Specimens of Macoma balthica and Mytilus edulis were collected along several Arctic estuaries in the White and Pechora seas; whole tissues for AL balthica and the digestive gland and gills for Al. edulis were dissected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized onboard. Metallothionein concentrations were determined by a polarographic assay. From the same stations organisms and sediments were also collected for metal analysis. The results revealed significant differences in metallothionein concentrations among the stations for Al, balthica. Similar, although less marked, differences were also obtained in the organs of M. edulis. Data on metallothionein were compared with trace metal concentrations in both the organisms and sediments. Also, the relationship with abiotic factors (salinity) and biological variables (size of sampled organisms) was determined. In particular, biological variables seemed to influence metallothionein concentration in the organisms and their effect should be carefully considered for a correct assessment of differences between stations.

Water chemistry of tundra lakes in the periglacial zone of the Bellsund Fiord (Svalbard) in the summer of 2013,"Szuminska, D; Szopinska, M; Lehmann-Konera, S; Franczak, L; Kociuba, W; Chmiel, S; Kalinowski, P; Polkowska, Z","Climate changes observed in the Arctic (e.g. permafrost degradation, glacier retreat) may have significant influence on sensitive polar wetlands. The main objectives of this paper arc defining chemical features of water within six small arctic lakes located in Bellsund (Svalbard) in the area of continuous permafrost occurrence. The unique environmental conditions of the study area offer an opportunity to observe phenomena influencing water chemistry, such as: chemical weathering, permafrost thawing, marine aerosols, atmospheric deposition and biological inputs. In the water samples collected during the summer 2013, detailed tundra lake water chemistry characteristics regarding ions, trace elements, pH and specific electrolytic conductivity (SEC25) analysis were determined. Moreover, water chemistry of the studied lakes was compared to the water samples from the Tyvjobekken Creek and precipitation water samples. As a final step of data analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed. Detailed chemical analysis allowed us to conclude what follows: (1) Ca2+, Mg2+, SO4(2-), Sr are of geogenic origin, (2) NO3(-) present in tundra lakes and the Tyvjobekken Creek water samples (ranging from 0.31 to 1.69 mg L-1 and from 0.25 to 1.58 mg L-1 respectively) may be of mixed origin, i.e. from biological processes and permafrost thawing, (3) high contribution of non-sea-salt SO42- > 80% in majority of studied samples indicate considerable inflow of sulphate-rich air to the study area, (4) high content of chlorides in tundra lakes (range: 25.6-32.0% meq L-1) indicates marine aerosol influence, (5) PCA result shows that atmospheric transport may constitute a source of Mn, Co, Ni.

Here we studied accumulation of heavy metals in brown crab (Cancer pagurus) and seafloor sediment from J & oslash;ssingfjord, Norway during 2018 to evaluate long-term, legacy pollution effects of coastal mine tailing sea disposal activities. Nickel and copper sediment pollution in the mine tailing sea disposal area was classified as moderate and severe, respectively, under Norwegian environmental quality standards, and highlights the persistent hazard and legacy impacts of heavy metals in these impacted fjord ecosystems. Mercury, zinc, and arsenic had stronger affinities to brown crab muscle likely due to the presence of thiols, and availability of metal binding sites. Our multi -isotopic composition data showed that lead isotopes were the most useful source apportionment tool for this fjord. Overall, our study highlights the importance and value of measuring several different heavy metals and multiple isotopic signatures in different crab organs and seafloor sediment to comprehensively evaluate fjord pollution and kinetic uptake dynamics.

"Impacts of anthropogenic activities and glacial processes on the distribution of chemical elements in Billefjord, Svalbard, Arctic","Souza-Kasprzyk, J; Kozak, L; Niedzielski, P","The Arctic region is undergoing rapid and extensive transformations due to global climate change. This study investigated the spatial distribution of 31 chemical elements in eight locations in Billefjord, Svalbard, Arctic, with varying degrees of anthropogenic and glacial influences. The west coast of Billefjord has experienced a greater historical anthropogenic impact, while the east coast has larger glaciers and shows less visible evidence of direct human impact. Over 450 topsoil samples collected in the west (abandoned mining town Pyramiden, and glacial valleys of Elsa, Ferdinand, Sven) and east coast of the fjord (glacial valleys of Ebba, Pollock, Ragnar and nearby the Nordenskio center dot ld glacier). These samples were extracted and analyzed by ICP-OES. The results revealed complex distributions of elements among the locations. Nordenskio center dot ld glacier area, along with other locations in the eastern part of the Billefjord, had significantly higher levels of most elements (20 out of 31; As, B, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, K, Li, Mg, Mo, Sb, Se, Sn, Sr, Ti, Tl, U, V, Zr). In contrast, Ferdinand Valley and other locations on the western side of the fjord had the lowest mean concentrations of most elements (18 out of 31; B, Ca, Cu, Cd, K, Li, P, Mg, Mo, Sb, Se, Sn, Sr, Ti, Tl, U, V, Zr). These findings highlight the significant influence of glacial processes on the elemental composition of soils within the region. The meltwater flow originating from glaciers in the sampled valleys contributes to the local element load, while the loss of glacier mass is associated with decreased element concentrations within these valleys. These results underscore the complexity of element distribution in the study area and emphasize the necessity for continuous monitoring efforts in this unique and environmentally sensitive region.",2024,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,909,,,WOS:001119268500001,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168534,,#89,Souza-Kasprzyk 2024,,primary source; sediment; terrestrial

Pollution of Russian Northern Seas with Heavy Metals: Comparison of Atmospheric Flux and River Flow,"Vinogradova, AA; Kotova, EI","Fluxes of anthropogenic heavy metals (Pb, Cd, As, Zn, Ni, Cr, and Cu) to the surface of four seas (White, Pechora, Kara, and Laptev seas) in the Russian Arctic have been estimated in this work using previously calculated concentrations of these elements in the surface atmosphere in some island and continental points of the Arctic Ocean. The obtained values were compared with the published data on the fluxes of the same components carried by waters flowing into the seas. Based on EMEP reports, we made some corrections for the data on lead and cadmium fluxes from the atmosphere to White and Pechora sea waters, taking into account pollution sources from European countries and the contribution of processes of the raising of dust and soil particles by wind to the pollution of the European part of Russia. On the whole, the contribution of atmospheric fluxes of HMs to the formation of the environment composition of northern Russian seas is significantly lower than that of the runoff of rivers flowing into the seas. The White Sea is the exception; it is exposed to numerous anthropogenic sources of HM emissions into the atmosphere. It is also reasonable to expect the atmospheric transport of HMs to make a significant contribution to these waters. One can also expect a significant contribution of the atmospheric transport of HMs to waters of distant seas (the Kara and Laptev seas), namely, in the parts of these seas where the influence of largest Siberian rivers (Ob, Yenisei, and Lena) is insignificant.",2019,,IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS,55,7,695-704,WOS:000504189200003,10.1134/S0001433819070119,,#99,Vinogradova 2019,PIERRE  BLEVIN (2025-07-14 18:22:09)(Screen): Pechora sea is part of the geo area based on the map I see on the protocole; Sam Welch (2025-07-10 16:56:27)(Screen): may be out of spatial scope?; ,marine; projection/estimation; terrestrial

Green sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) as potential biomonitors of metal pollution near a former lead-zinc mine in West Greenland,"Sondergaard, J; Hansson, SV; Mosbech, A; Bach, L","In this study, metal accumulation in green sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) was investigated near the former Black Angel lead-zinc mine in Maarmorilik, West Greenland. Sea urchins (n = 9-11; 31-59 mm in diameter) were collected from three stations located at < 1 km, 5 km, and 12 km (reference site) away from the former mine site, respectively. After collection, tissue of the sea urchins was divided into gonads and remaining soft parts (viscera) before subjected to chemical analyses. Focus was on eight elements found in elevated concentrations in the mine waste (iron, copper, zinc, arsenic, silver, cadmium, mercury and lead). Sea urchins at the mine site contained significantly more copper, mercury and lead compared with the reference site for both the gonads and viscera, while the latter also contained significantly more iron, zinc and silver. Arsenic and cadmium were not significantly elevated in sea urchins at the mine site. Most elements were found in higher concentrations in the viscera compared with the gonads. For comprehensive monitoring of metal pollution at mine sites, a diverse selection of monitoring organisms is necessary. The study shows that green sea urchins accumulate selected metals and can be used as a monitoring organism for mining pollution, at least for iron, copper, zinc, silver, mercury and lead. However, the results also show that green sea urchins are less likely to reflect small environmental changes in loading of most metals (except iron, copper and silver) and for arsenic compared to suspension feeders such as blue mussels.",2019,,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,191,9,,WOS:000480243200003,10.1007/s10661-019-7637-3,,#105,Sondergaard 2019,,biota; marine; primary source
"Metals in some dominant vascular plants, mosses, lichens, algae, and the biological soil crust in various types of terrestrial tundra, SW Spitsbergen, Norway","Wojtun, B; Samecka-Cymerman, A; Kolon, K; Kempers, AJ; Skrzypek, G","Arctic environments are commonly considered to be relatively pristine because of minimal local human activity. However, these areas receive air pollution from lower latitude regions. Our goal was to determine concentrations of metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in dominant species of vascular plants, mosses, lichens, algae, and in the biological soil crust (BSC), and topsoil (0-3 cm) from various types of tundra in the southwestern part of Spitsbergen, Norway. Results indicate that mosses are more efficient bioaccumulators of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn than lichens. The highest levels of Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, and Pb were found in the BSC, and the moss species Racomitrium lanuginosum, Sanionia uncinata, and Straminergon stramineum from the polygonal tundra, initial cyanobacteria-moss wet tundra, snow bed cyanobacteria-moss tundra, and flow water moss tundra alimented by melting ice or snow. The observed higher concentrations of Cu and lower concentrations of Hg in mosses, lichens, and vascular plants compared with values observed 20 years earlier were apparently associated with changes in the atmospheric deposition of contaminants over Spitsbergen due to changes in the long-distance transport of anthropogenic emissions from industrialized areas. Prasiola crispa and Salix polaris may be useful bioindicators of Cd and Zn, and the BSC, R. lanuginosum, S. uncinata, and S. stramineum as bioindicators of Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, and Pb.

"Metal Distributions in Tigriopus brevicornis (Crustacea, Copepoda) Exposed to Copper, Zinc, Nickel, Cadmium, Silver, and Mercury, and Implication for Subsequent Transfer in the Food Web","Barka, S; Pavilion, JF; Amiard-Triquet, C","The marine copepod Tigriopus brevicornis is a benthic microcrustacean inhabiting splashed rock pools in the intertidal zone. The genus has a worldwide distribution, and some species play an important role as a link in trophic webs. It is well established that many crustaceans are able to survive in contaminated environments by storing metallic pollutants in detoxified form, and thus, they may represent a source of contaminants for their predators. The present study was designed to determine the distribution of bioaccumulated metals, both essential and nonessential, with a view to assessing their availability to the next trophic level. Groups of 1000-1500 adult copepods were exposed for 1-14 days to Ag, Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, and Zn in water. Three concentrations, chosen to be realistic in comparison with those encountered in polluted environments, were tested for each metal. Copepods were homogenized and metals were analyzed in supernatants (i.e., metals stored in soluble form in soft tissues or easily remobilized from the exoskeleton) and pellets (including metal-rich detoxificatory granules or with cellular debris) recovered after centrifugation. Another experiment, consisting of desorption tests, was designed to evaluate the fraction of metals loosely bound onto the exoskeleton. The bioaccumulation ability is highly variable, as shown by the ratios between the concentrations reached in T brevicornis experimentally exposed to different metals (at higher dose and at day 14) and those in controls (7, 12, 18, 26, 53, and 99, respectively, for Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd, Ag, and Hg). Cu, Zn, and Ni concentrations in copepods increased linearly with time over the whole range of exposure concentrations, whereas a plateau body metal concentration was reached with time particularly at the highest exposure concentrations for Cd, Ag, and Hg. Metals bound onto the exoskeleton were remobilized to different extents, the percentages of desorption being 11, 14, 16, 19, 31, and 32, respectively, for Zn, Cd, Cu, Ni, Ag, and Hg.

"A study of metal concentrations and metallothionein binding capacity in liver, kidney and brain tissues of three Arctic seal species","Sonne, C; Aspholm, O; Dietz, R; Andersen, S; Berntssen, MHG; Hylland, K","Arctic seals are known to accumulate relatively high concentrations of potential toxic heavy metals in their vital organs. such as livers and kidneys, as well as in their central nervous system. We therefore decided to determine whether mercury, copper, cadmium and zinc levels in liver, kidney and brain tissues of three Arctic seal species were associated with the intracellular metal-binding protein metallothionein (MT) as a sign of toxic exposure. Samples from four ringed (Phoca hispida), five harp (P. groenlandica) and five hooded (Cystophona cristata) seals taken during field trips to Central West Greenland (Godhavn) and the Barents Sea in the spring of 1999 were used for the present study. In all three seal species concentrations of mercury. zinc and copper were highest in the liver, except for cadmium which was highest in the kidneys. Metal concentrations increased significantly in the order: ringed seal < harp seal <hooded seal for both kidney and liver tissues. MT concentrations were highest in the kidneys and the concentrations increased in the order: ringed seal < hooded seal < harp seal. MIT metal-binding capacity was highest in the kidneys for all three species and increased in the same order: ringed seals (2-10%) < hooded seals (8-15%) < harp seals (27-63%). We therefore suggest that there are species-specific differences in the sub-cellular handling of heavy metals which indicate differences in sensitivity and health implications. However, a larger sample size is needed in order to test the relationship between metal concentrations and MT up-regulation in order to decide which metals are the most important and to elucidate whether the MT binding capacity is sufficient to protect tissues (i.e. kidney) from metal toxicosis. MT with its binding capacity could be a useful marker for environmental exposure to metals and their potential toxicity in the Arctic. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Geochemical assessment of gold mine tailings proposed for marine tailings disposal,"Matthies, R; Bowell, RJ; Williams, KP","A preliminary geochemical study on gold mine tailings proposed for marine tailings disposal has been undertaken to identify the potential release of acidity and ecotoxic elements. Laboratory tests investigated the effects of flushing media, temperatures and light-exposure on the reactivity and acid generation potential of the tailing. Based on low sulphide and carbonate concentrations, ambiguous static test results categorized the tailing as 'uncertain to potential-acid-generating'. Over a 20-week kinetic test programme, tailing leachates remained circum-neutral and metal release rates decreased substantially after the first-flush. However, Canadian Interim Quality guidelines for marine sediment were exceeded for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn by factors ranging between 1.5 (Zn) and 196 (As) and kinetic leachate concentrations of Cd exceeded Canadian Marine Aquatic Life guidelines suggesting potentially harmful effects might occur upon disposal of the tailing in marine environment. Leaching of ecotoxic elements was enhanced by the use of seawater as flushing medium. Changes in temperature and light exposure had only minor effects. In-situ long-term (> 20 weeks) leaching tests are proposed.",2011,,GEOCHEMISTRY-EXPLORATION ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS,11,1,41-50,WOS:000286803000003,10.1144/1467-7873/09-016,,#118,Matthies 2011,,lab study; marine; primary source
Elemental composition of Arctic soils and aerosols in Ny-Ålesund measured using laser -induced breakdown spectroscopy,"Kim, G; Yoon, YJ; Kim, HA; Cho, HJ; Park, K","Two laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) systems (soil LIBS and aerosol LIBS) were used to determine the elemental composition of soils and ambient aerosols less than 2.5 mu m in Ny-Alesund, Svalbard (the world's most northerly human settlement). For soil LIBS measurements, matrix effects such as moisture content, soil grain size, and surrounding gas on the LIBS response were minimized. When Ar gas was supplied onto the soil sample surfaces, a significant enhancement in LIBS emission lines was observed. Arctic soil samples were collected at 10 locations, and various elements (Al, Ba, C, Ca, Cu, Fe, H, K, Mg, Mn, N, Na, O, Pb, and Si) were detected in soils. The elemental distribution in arctic soils was clearly distinguishable from those in urban and abandoned mining soils in Korea. Moreover, the concentrations of most of anthropogenic metals were fairly low, and localized sources in extremely close proximity affected the elevated level of Cu in the soil samples derived from Ny-Alesund. The number of elements detected in aerosols (C, Ca, H, K, Mg, Na, and 0) was lower than those determined in soils. The elements in aerosols can mainly originate from minerals and sea salts. The elemental distribution in aerosols was also clearly distinguishable from that in soils, suggesting that the resuspension of local soil particles by wind erosion into aerosols was minimal. The daily variation of particle number concentration (RSD = 71%) and the elements in aerosols (RSD = 25%) varied substantially, possibly due to fluctuating air masses and meteorological conditions.

Bone as a surrogate tissue to monitor metals in baleen whales,"Vighi, M; Borrell, A; Aguilar, A","Metals are massively deposited in the marine environment through direct emissions or atmospheric dry and wet depositions, a process since long enhanced by human activities. Metal contamination in the marine organisms has been increasingly investigated, but most research focuses on few tissues, elements and species considered indicative. Baleen whales have been scarcely studied in this respect. Here we contribute to the fragmented knowledge on this field examining the concentrations of zinc, copper, lead, titanium and strontium in the bone of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) from NW Spain and W Iceland. Bone was selected because it is a tissue commonly available in archival historic collections, and it is therefore useful to examine long-term trends in metal pollution. We tested differences between populations and we investigated age- and sex-related accumulation trends, as well as the occurrence of placental transfer. Sr concentrations and Pb accumulation rates with age were significantly higher in individuals from NW Spain than in those from W Iceland. Placental transfer occurred, at different levels, for all metals: as a result fetuses showed significantly higher Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations than adults. After birth, only Zn and Pb concentrations significantly increased with age. Through this study we contributed to fill some gaps in the knowledge regarding metal contamination in marine mammals, and we concluded that bone can be a suitable surrogate tissue to monitor a number of trace elements, provided that dissimilarities in tissue-specific deposition are taken into account when comparing concentrations from different tissues.

DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS OF MINE DRAINAGE ON BENTHOS AND FISH IN A NORWEGIAN RIVER - A COMPARISON OF THE SITUATION BEFORE AND AFTER RIVER REHABILITATION,"ARNEKLEIV, JV; STORSET, L","Parts of the Norwegian river Gaula are strongly polluted from former mining activity in the area.  In the most polluted parts of the river the concentration levels of Cu and Zn in 1986-1987 were up to 155 mug l-1 and 186 mug l-1, respectively.  In 1989 the spoil heaps in the mining area were covered with protective layers of moss-covered plastic.  In 1991-1992 the concentration levels of Cu and Zn had decreased by 75% and 65%, respectively.  Animal life in the polluted area seemed to be strongly affected by the trace metals in 1986-1987.  The 1991-1992 results showed a marked increase in the number of species and in the number of individuals of each species of Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera, compared with the results from 1986-87.  Good correlations were found between the concentrations of Cu in the water and both the number of species and the number of individuals of Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera.  Analysis of the species Baetis rhodani, Diura nanseni and Rhyacophila nubila showed an average total dry weight content of Cu up to 264 mug g-1, of Zn up to 1930 mug g-1 and of Cd up to 16 mug g-1.

Trace metal partitioning in the top meter of the ocean,"Tovar-Sánchez, A; González-Ortegón, E; Duarte, CM","Understanding the biogeochemical cycles and distribution of trace elements in the marine environment is one of the main challenges in chemical oceanography. We describe herein the trace metal composition of the uppermost surface ocean of various oceanographic regions (Arctic and Southern Oceans, subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and Mediterranean Sea). Our results show that trace metals in the top meter of the ocean are found in two clearly differentiated layers according to metal abundance and stoichiometry, namely the surface microlayer (SML) and its underlying subsurface water (SSW). Although metal concentrations in the subsurface dissolved fractions vary regionally and globally, it shows a singular metal stoichiometric signature. This work emphasizes the need to study of the SML as unique compartment to improve our understanding of the biogeochemical cycle of trace metals in the surface ocean, especially for metals, such as Pb, Fe and Cu, which are abundant in the SML.

Brown trout (Salmo trutta) metallothioneins as biomarkers for metal exposure in two Norwegian rivers,"Olsvik, PA; Hindar, K; Zachariassen, KE; Andersen, RA","The potential use of the metal binding protein metallothionein (MT) as a biomarker for trace metal exposure has been evaluated in brown trout (Salmo trutta) from the Cu-contaminated Rugla and the Cd/Zn-contaminated Naustebekken Norwegian rivers, as well as in hatchery control trout. Metal concentrations were measured in gills, liver and kidney as well as in ambient water, and compared with Cd/Zn MT and Cu MT levels, measured by two Cd-saturation techniques. In addition haematocrit, plasma chloride and condition factors (weight x 100/length(3)) were measured, and genetic diversity determined. A negative correlation was found between the Cd/Zn MT content and the condition factor in the different trout populations, and Naustebekken trout, having the lowest condition factor, were less heterozygous than Rugla trout, indicating that Naustebekken trout have adapted to the metal in their environment. Significant positive correlations were found between accumulated levels of Cd and Cd/Zn MT in liver and kidney, suggesting that liver and kidney, but not gill, Cd/Zn MT can be used as a biomarker for chronic Cd exposure. Cu MT seems less suitable as a biomarker for Cu exposure.

During 2013-2014, we collected samples of different berry, mushroom, fish, and game species from sites at varying distances from the Ni-Cu smelter in all three border regions. Our results indicate that the Ni-Cu smelter is the main source of Ni, Co, and As in local wild foods, whereas the sources of Pb and Cd are more complex. We observed no consistent trends for Cu, one of the main toxic elements emitted by the Ni-Cu smelter; nor did we find any trend for Hg in wild food.

Arctic catchment as a sensitive indicator of the environmental changes: distribution and migration of metals (Svalbard),"Kozak, K; Polkowska, Z; Stachnik, L; Luks, B; Chmiel, S; Ruman, M; Lech, D; Koziol, K; Tsakovski, S; Simeonov, V","Arctic regions experience metal pollution, despite their remote location, and the distribution and migration of those metals determine their potential impact on the local environment. Here, a High-Arctic catchment (Revelva, Svalbard) located remotely from human-induced pollution sources is studied with respect to the distribution and migration of chosen trace elements (Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Cs, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sr, Tl, U, V and Zn) in surface waters. The metal concentrations fluctuated in 2010-2012 between 0.01 and 354 mu g L-1, the highest mean-weighted concentration noted for Sr (42.5 mu g L-1). The concentrations in the river water were likely influenced by both natural and human-activity-related processes. These factors can produce substances of the same chemical composition (e.g. carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and metals may be emitted both by a volcanic eruption and by industrial sources). Therefore, chemometric techniques were used in the current paper to distinguish the multiple sources of pollution in the Revelva catchment. The authors were seeking to determine whether there is indeed evidence for contamination, sufficient to cause environmental damage in polar region. As a result, it was shown that the long-range transport could play an important role in shaping the metal concentration profile of this Arctic tundra environment, capturing both the influence of volcanic eruptions within the region and the human activity in a range of distances from the study site.",2016,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,13,12,2779-2796,WOS:000388722600003,10.1007/s13762-016-1137-6,,#135,Kozak 2016,,freshwater; primary source
Concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and trace elements in Arctic soils: A case-study in Svalbard,"Marquès, M; Sierra, J; Drotikova, T; Mari, M; Nadal, M; Domingo, JL","A combined assessment on the levels and distribution profiles of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and trace elements in soils from Pyramiden (Central Spitsbergen, Svalbard Archipelago) is here reported. As previously stated, long-range atmospheric transport, coal deposits and previous mining extractions, as well as the stack emissions of two operative power plants at this settlement are considered as potential sources of pollution. Eight top-layer soil samples were collected and analysed for the 16 US EPA priority PAHs and for 15 trace elements (As, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sn, TI, V and Zn) during late summer of 2014. The highest levels of PAHs and trace elements were found in sampling sites located near two power plants, and at downwind from these sites. The current PAH concentrations were even higher than typical threshold values. The determination of the pyrogenic molecular diagnostic ratios (MDRs) in most samples revealed that fossil fuel burning might be heavily contributing to the PAHs levels. Two different indices, the Pollution Load Index (PLI) and the Geoaccumulation Index (Igeo), were determined for assessing soil samples with respect to trace elements pollution. Samples collected close to the power plants were found to be slightly and moderately polluted with zinc (Zn) and mercury (Hg), respectively. The Spearman correlation showed significant correlations between the concentrations of 16 PAHs and some trace elements (Pb, V, Hg, Cu, Zn, Sn, Be) with the organic matter content, indicating that soil properties play a key role for pollutant retention in the Arctic soils. Furthermore, the correlations between Sigma 16 PAHs and some trace elements (e.g., Hg, Pb, Zn and Cu) suggest that the main source of contamination is probably pyrogenic, although the biogenic and petrogenic origin of PAHs should not be disregarded according to the local geology.",2017,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,159,,202-211,WOS:000413280500023,10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.003,,#139,Marquès 2017,PIERRE  BLEVIN (2025-07-17 04:50:55)(Screen): Source to mar env?; ,terrestrial
"A 150-year record of heavy metals in the varved sediments of Lake Bolterskardet, Svalbarl","Sun, Q; Chu, GQ; Liu, JQ; Gao, DY","Laminated sediments from Bolterskardet Lake on Svalbard provide a new 150-year record of heavy metals in the Arctic. Independent data of (CS)-C-137 and Pb-210 indicate that these laminations are annually deposited varves. The high sedimentation rate and varved sediments make Lake Bolterskardet a good site for studying history of heavy metal pollution in the region. A suite of heavy metals (Pb, As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Co, Ni, and Sn) were studied. The variations of Cu, Cr, Co, and Ni concentrations show an inverse pattern with the median grain size. It suggests that the particle size has a significant role in the accumulation and enrichment of heavy metals in the sediments. In the concentration profiles of studied heavy metals, only Pb concentrations show a significant increase from the lower parts to the upper parts of the core. Profiles of ""total,"" ""lithogenic,"" and ""anthropogenic"" Pb flux also show an increasing pattern. Anthropogenic Ph flux varies between 0.1 mu g cm(-2) yr(-1) and 12.3 mu g cm(-2) yr(-1), with a mean value of 2.4 mu g cm(-2) yr(-1). The anthropogenic Pb fluxes were relatively low at around 0.7 mu g cm(-2) yr(-1) prior to 1945, slowly increased after 1945, and reached a sidestep (between 1940s and 1970s) with mean value of 1.8 mu g cm(-2) yr(-1). Second high value period was between 1980s and 1990s with mean value of 5.9 mu g cm(-2) yr(-1). The variation of anthropogenic Pb fluxes before 1970 in Bolterskardet Lake coincides with the sulfate record and Pb concentration data from Greenland snow and ice, and the acidity concentration in the Svalbard ice cores. However, the anthropogenic Pb fluxes during the last two decades show a rapidly increasing trend.

Additionally, pH, electrical conductivity and total organic carbon (TOC) were determined in those samples. The acidic reaction of precipitation waters was identified as an important factor intensifying the metal migration in this Arctic tundra environment. The air mass trajectory, surprisingly, explained the variability of only a small fraction of trace elements in precipitation water. The air mass origin area was correlated only with the concentrations of As, V and Cr. Wind directions were helpful in explaining the variability of Mn, U and Ba concentrations (east-north-easterly wind) and the contents of B, As, Rb, Se, Sr and Li in precipitation (south-westerly wind), which may indicate the local geological source of those.

In the present study, meals were produced from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), Arctic krill (Thysanoessa inermis) and the Arctic amphipod Themisto libellula. Diets were then prepared for Atlantic salmon and Atlantic cod where up to 100% of the fish meal protein was replaced by protein from these organisms. Concentrations of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) were determined by ICP-MS in the various krill and amphipod meals, complete diets and muscle samples from fish fed these diets. The element concentrations were related to growth and general fish health as well as present EU legislations on feed ingredients and complete diets. The cod showed no difference in growth during the trial, while salmon fed diets where 40% of the fish meal protein was replaced with Arctic krill or amphipod meal shoved improved SGR during the first period of feeding (first 100 days). No adverse effects on growth rate or fish health were observed in any fish species or treatment. Nevertheless, high levels of Cu were found in the meal from Antarctic krill (46 mg kg(-1) dry matter (dm)) resulting in a dietary level of Cu exceeding the upper limit for complete feedingstuff set by EU. Furthermore, the Cd level found in the meal from amphipod (12 mg kg(-1) dm) was 6 times higher than EU's upper limit. This indicates limitations for the use of certain zooplanktons as alternative protein sources in feed for farmed fish, unless future processing methods yield lower levels of these unwanted elements.

In this study, sediment samples from sites within the Pasvik River area with different histories of metal input were analyzed for metal contamination and occurrence of metal-resistant bacteria in late spring and summer of 2014. The major differences in microbial and chemical parameters were mostly dependent on local inputs than seasonality. Higher concentrations of metals were generally detected in July rather than May, with inner stations that became particularly enriched in Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn, but without significant differences. Bacterial resistance to metals, which resulted from viable counts on amended agar plates, was in the order Ni2+>Pb2+>Co2+>Zn2+>Cu2+>Cd2+>Hg2+, with higher values that were generally determined at inner stations.

Climate Change increases the risk of metal toxicity in Arctic zooplankton,"Halsband, C; Thomsen, N; Reinardy, HC","This mini-review outlines major climate-change exacerbated sources of metal to the Arctic marine environment, leading to measured concentrations sometimes exceeding levels considered environmentally safe, and thus potentially impacting arctic marine zooplankton. We review the bioavailability of metals in Arctic marine environments and the current state of knowledge on metal toxicity in marine copepods. Toxicity response mechanisms to metals included oxidative stress as well as genetic processes of DNA damage and repair. We highlight species-specific differences in metal impacts within the diverse group of planktonic copepods. We summarize observed responses at multiple levels of biological organization, and note that studies on arctic species are scarce and need expansion, as results from temperate and tropical species may not be readily transferable to arctic counterparts. We further provide an updated view on impacts of metals in combination with other stressors in the Arctic marine system in light of increasing attention to multiple stressors of climate change and pollution. For arctic marine zooplankton, a number of research gaps are identified, including a need for integrating effects responses across levels of biological organization, for studies into mechanisms of heritable changes and long-term transgenerational impacts, and considering interspecific capacity for response and adaptation.",2024,,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,11,,,WOS:001380607100001,10.3389/fmars.2024.1510718,,#185,Halsband 2024,"Sam Welch (2025-07-18 18:26:15)(Select): This is a short review/project paper about metals and the arctic.

Physicochemical and spectroscopic properties of natural organic matter (NOM) from various sources and implications for ameliorative effects on metal toxicity to aquatic biota,"Al-Reasi, HA; Wood, CM; Smith, DS","Natural organic matter (NOM), expressed as dissolved organic carbon (DOC in mgC L-1), is an ubiquitous complexing agent in natural waters, and is now recognized as an important factor mitigating water-borne metal toxicity. However, the magnitude of the protective effect, judged by toxicity measures (e.g. LC50), varies substantially among different NOM sources even for similar DOC concentrations, implying a potential role of NOM physicochemical properties or quality of NOM. This review summarizes some key quality parameters for NOM samples, obtained by reverse osmosis, and by using correlation analyses, investigates their contribution to ameliorating metal toxicity towards aquatic biota. At comparable and environmentally realistic DOC levels, molecular spectroscopic characteristics (specific absorbance coefficient, SAC, and fluorescence index, FI) as well as concentrations of fluorescent fractions obtained from mathematical mixture resolution techniques (PARAFAC), explain considerable variability in the protective effects. NOM quality clearly influences the toxicity of copper (Cu) and lead (Pb). NOM quality may also influence the toxicity of silver (Ag), cadmium (Cd) and inorganic mercury (Hg), but as yet insufficient data are available to unequivocally support the latter correlations between toxicity reduction and NOM quality predictors. Cu binding capacities, protein-to-carbohydrate ratio, and lipophilicity, show insignificant correlation to the amelioration offered by NOMs, but these conclusions are based on data for Norwegian NOMs with very narrow ranges for the latter two parameters. Certainly, various NOMs alleviate metal toxicity differentially and therefore their quality measures should be considered in addition to their quantity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The importance of sulphide binding for leaching of heavy metals from contaminated Norwegian marine sediments treated by stabilization/solidification,"Sparrevik, M; Eek, E; Grini, RS","Over time, Norwegian fjords and harbour areas have received contaminants from industrial activities and urban run-off, and measures to remediate contaminated marine sediments are therefore needed. Stabilization/solidification (S/S) technology, in which the contaminated marine sediments are mixed with cement and other binding agents, has been shown to be a promising remediation technology. This paper summarizes a study of the environmental effect of stabilization, highlighting the importance of sulphide binding governing the leaching of heavy metals from the S/S of contaminated marine sediments. The study is a part of a research project focusing on developing effective methods for S/S of contaminated seabed sediments for use in new construction areas. Four cementitious binders were tested on sediments from six different locations: Bergen, Gilhus, Grenland, Hammerfest, Sandvika and Trondheim. The sediments differed with respect to properties such as concentration of contaminants, water content, organic content and grain size distribution. Portland cement, Portland cement with fly ash, industry cement, and sulphate resistant cement, were tested as binders. The leaching from the S/S sediments after 28 days of curing was measured by using a standard leaching batch test (EN 12457-2: 2003), with seawater as leaching agent. The eluate was analysed for pH and redox, as well as content of heavy metals and organic contaminants. Available volatile sulphide (AVS) and simultaneously extractable metals (SEM) were also measured in the sediments. This paper focuses on the leaching of lead (Pb) and copper (Cu). A reduced leaching of Pb after stabilization was observed for the mixtures, whereas the leaching of Cu from Hammerfest sediments increased substantially after stabilization for all cementitious additions. Experiments show that Hammerfest samples had lower values of AVS than the other sediments. This was confirmed by the SEM/AVS analysis, highlighting the importance of sulphide binding for mobility of heavy metals in stabilized marine sediments. For practical application of S/S technology to contaminated sediments, it is important to assess the leachability of the stabilized material taking sediment conditions such as AVS content into account. It is however important to be aware that the mobility of contaminants from a S/S sediment is dependent on a combination of contaminant concentrations and hydraulic conductivity (permeability). When devising S/S procedures for environmental projects, in addition to physical strength, the binder should be optimized in relation to leaching and permeability in order to achieve the lowest transport of contaminants through the material.",2009,,ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY,30,8,831-840,WOS:000267602300008,10.1080/09593330902990121,,#188,Sparrevik 2009,,Cu environmental chemistry; marine; pre-2010; sediment
Histology of Sculpin spp. in East Greenland. II. Histopathology and trace element concentrations,"Kaarsholm, HM; Verland, N; Norregaard, RD; Bach, L; Sondergaard, J; Rigét, FF; Dietz, R; Hansen, M; Eulaers, I; Desforges, JP; Leifsson, PS; Dang, M; Nowak, B; Sonne, C","For many years, the sculpin has been utilized as a sentinel monitoring species for anthropogenic impacts on the marine environment. To further develop its potential as a screening model body burden of several trace elements, including cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb) and selenium (Se), were investigated. In addition, histopathology in shorthorn sculpins (Myoxocephalus scorpius; n = 20) and fourhorn sculpins (Myoxocephalus quadricornis; n = 10) were examined at three sites around the Scoresby Sound settlement in Central East Greenland. Fourhorn sculpins caught at the most distant site from the settlement, contained significantly higher hepatic Cu and Cd concentrations as well as significantly elevated gill Pb levels compared to the shorthorn sculpins collected at two other sites closer to the settlement. Histological examinations showed that fish with significantly higher concentrations of hepatic Cd and Se exhibited greater nuclear alterations, interstitial hyperplasia/hypertrophy, interstitial mononuclear infiltrations and granulomas. Further, fish with higher Cd and Cu gill tissue levels displayed a significantly higher number of cytoplasmic alterations and lamellar epithelium lifting, hypertrophic and hyperplastic epithelium along with mucus cell hyperplasia. While the presence of liver lesions were not species or sex-specific, the presence of gill lesions decreased in the order female fourhorn sculpins > female shorthorn sculpins> male fourhorn sculpins > male shorthorn sculpins. Hepatic Hg concentrations exceeded known lowest observable effect doses (LOED) for fish (0.1-0.5 mu g g(-1) ww) in 27% of fish, while liver Cd residues in 80% exceeded LOED (0.42-1.8 mu g g(-1) ww).

Heavy metal concentrations in peat profiles from the high Arctic,"Headley, AD","The concentration and possible sources of heavy metal input to a high Arctic mire in Kongsfjord, West Spitsbergen were examined; levels of lead, copper and zinc are highest in the surface humus closest to the carboniferous limestone cliff upon which seabirds nest. The concentrations of iron, manganese, nickel, copper, zinc and lead in two cores of peat increase markedly in the upper 5 cm of consolidated peat, with the highest concentrations found in the uppermost centimetre of peat. There has, therefore, been an increase in heavy metal loading to this High Arctic mire within the last 100 years. This cannot be attributed to the direct input of heavy metals from precipitation or coal dust from the local mines as the concentrations of the same elements in these materials are three orders of magnitude lower. It is only in the vicinity of seabird colonies that this pattern is shown and the concentrations (mu g g(-1) dry wt.) of lead, copper and zinc in faecal samples of kittiwake and glaucous gull are in the range 17-32, 35-65 and 63-260, respectively. The concentrations of these heavy metals in the faeces are close to those found in the surface layers of humus closest to the cliff.

Determination of Nanoparticles and Elements in Blue Mussels (Mytilus edulis) along the Norwegian Coastline,"Bruvold, AS; Valdersnes, S; Bienfait, AM; Sanden, M; Loeschner, K","Our work aimed to examine nanoparticle levels in 69 distinct pooled mussel samples along the Norwegian coastline, considering samples from different environmental contexts, including natural locations, potentially polluted hotspots, and mussel farms. Single-particle ICP-MS was utilized to determine particle mass and number concentrations at environmentally relevant levels in addition to the total content of 11 elements: aluminum, barium, cerium, copper, iron, manganese, lead, silicon, silver, titanium, and zirconium. Results showed nanoparticle mass concentrations of few ng/g up to tens of mu g/g and number concentrations of 106 to 109 particles/g (wet weight). Certain urban and industrially impacted locations were linked to increased levels of, e.g., silver, lead, cerium, zirconium, and titanium NPs. Farmed mussels exhibited lower concentrations.

What influences heavy metals accumulation in arctic lichen Cetrariella delisei in Svalbard?,"Wegrzyn, M; Wietrzyk, P; Lisowska, M; Klimek, B; Nicia, P","The main aim of this study was to identify variations in heavy metal concentrations in Cetrariella delisei along a transect from a High Arctic glacier forehead to the shoreline as well as determine the main environmental factors influencing the deposition of heavy metals in arctic lichens. The macrolichen Cetrariella delisei appears to be an interesting alternative to those lichen species used in the past (e.g. Flavocetraria nivalis, Cladonia sp.) for heavy metal biomonitoring purposes in the Arctic: it is widely distributed, easy to identify and reluctantly grazed by reindeer. Fieldwork was conducted in the summer of 2012 in the Kaffioyra Plain, Oskar II Land, NW Spitsbergen. C. delisei and soil samples were collected from 5 localities. Concentrations of Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd were measured in each sample. A bioaccumulation factor (BAF) was calculated for all the analyzed elements. The BAFs for Cu, Mn, and Ni showed a relatively low accumulation level in lichen thalli. On the other hand, the BAFs for Cr, Pb, and Zn, revealed an increased accumulation level in C. delisei. The Cd content in lichen is almost equal to its level in the soil. The statistical analyses covered three environmental factors: soil pH, substrate type and distance from the shoreline. The data were examined using the Kruskal-Wallis test, canonical correspondence analysis and a permutation test. The results show that distance from the shoreline had the greatest influence on the majority of the heavy metal concentrations in the lichen thalli and the soil. However, the level of Mn accumulated in the soil is determined by its source in the glacier. Moreover, the soil pH had the greatest effect on the Cd accumulated in the soil and the Mn accumulated in the lichen thalli. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR.

Setting sediment quality guidelines:: A simple yet effective method,"Bjorgesæter, A; Gray, JS","Deriving sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for marine sediments is a difficult task. It will often be a trade off between reproducibility and relevance. One of the fundamental questions in ecotoxicology is to decide what one should measure to detect response in ecosystems exposed to human disturbance. In this paper we use field data to estimate threshold levels eliciting effects on soft bottom macrobenthos collected at different sediment types and depths on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and test these against natural levels occurring levels in reference conditions. SQGs are presented from multivariate analyses based on 121 gradients (represented with Ba, THC, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) incorporating more than 2000 species. Clear clusters with slightly disturbed communities related to contamination loadings were evident in 35% of the gradients. We found large variations in naturally occurring contamination concentrations and in the threshold levels electing effects on the fauna at different sediment types and depths. For example, an increase in depth of only 100 m can triple the Cu and Zn concentrations that elicit effects. Lowest background and threshold levels were found in shallow, sandy sediment. Our results suggest that current SQGs are too high. We hypothesised that setting a SQG of 4-times background concentrations will give sufficient protection for the fauna from metal contamination. The overall background concentration eliciting effects on metal was 3.6x. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Structure of sediment-associated microbial communities along a heavy-metal contamination gradient in the marine environment,"Gillan, DC; Danis, B; Pernet, P; Joly, G; Dubois, P","Microbial community composition and structure were characterized in marine sediments contaminated for >80 years with cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc. Four sampling sites that encompass a wide range of sediment metal loads were compared in a Norwegian fjord (Sorfjord). HCI-extractable metals and organic matter constantly decreased from the most contaminated site (SI) to the control site (S4). All sampling sites presented low polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations (Sigma(7)PCB < 7.0 ng g [dry weight](-1)) The biomass ranged from 4.3 X 10(8) to 13.4 X 10(8) cells g (dry weight) of sediments(-1) and was not correlated to metal levels. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis indicated that diversity was not affected by the contamination. The majority of the partial 16S rRNA sequences obtained were classified in the gamma- and delta-Proteobacteria and in the C,tophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides (CFB) bacteria. Some sequences were closely related to other sequences from polluted marine sediments. The abundances of seven phylogenetic groups were determined by using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). FISH was impaired in S1 by high levels of autofluorescing particles. For S2 to S4, the results indicated that the HCI-extractable Cu, Pb, and Zn were negatively correlated with the abundance of gamma-Proteobacteria and CFB bacteria. delta-Proteobacteria were not correlated with 110-extractable metals. Bacteria of the Desuffiosarcina-Desulfococcus group were detected in every site and represented 6 to 14% of the DAPI (4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole) counts.

Permafrost catchments off the west coast of Svalbard, described as ""thin"" and ""warm,"" are particularly sensitive to climate change. The interdisciplinary research on the hydrochemical response of surface and underground water functioning within a small permafrost catchment area focused on the determination of the impact of meteorological conditions (temperature (T), precipitation (P)) on the mean daily discharge (Q), and the lowering of the groundwater table (H). We determined physical and chemical properties (pH and SEC) and concentrations of major elements (Ca, Mg, Na, K) and 23 trace elements (i.a. Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, Zn) in 280 water samples. The results of the correlation matrix showed that an increase in the average air temperature in the summer of 2021 had a significant impact on the hydrochemistry of both types of waters operating in the catchment. In response to increase in T, the lowering of the H (0.52 < r < 0.66) and a decrease in Q (-0.66 < r < -0.68) were observed what in consequence also leads to changes in water chemistry. The principal component analysis (CA) indicates that chemical weathering and binding of elements to DOC are processes influencing water chemistry. Results of statistical analysis showed that the resultant of the hydrometeorological conditions that prevailed in that season and the type of geological formations on which they were located had a significant impact on the water chemistry at individual measurement points.

The deposited tailings are clearly enriched on the elements Ba, Bi, Cu, Hf and Zr and depleted of Ca, Li, Nb, Pb, Sc, V and Y. A hard pan horizon occurs at 20 cm sediment depth in large parts of the inner inlet, which seems to have precipitated during the deposition of tailings. New tailings were fabricated from the two local mineralisations and these display varying chemical results from each other but also in respect to the old, deposited tailings.

Underestimation of the authigenic fraction of Cu and Ni in organic-rich sediments,"Böning, P; Fröllje, H; Beck, M; Schnetger, B; Brumsack, HJ","There are two possible techniques to estimate the degree of authigenic (or non-lithogenic) metal enrichment in sediments. First, the authigenic metal fraction can be calculated according to M-auth = M-total - (M/Al-background center dot Al-total) while M is the metal of interest and Al is aluminum. Second, a metal enrichment factor (EF) is calculated according to EF = M/Al-total/M/Al-background. Both techniques rely on the appropriate use of the M/Al ratio of the lithogenic background. For the latter, the M/Al ratio of average shale or crust is widely applied as lithogenic background in marine geochemistry. However, as we show here, the lithogenic background based on average shale or crust is too high for Cu and Ni. As a consequence, the authigenic fraction of Cu and Ni in sediments and suspended particulate matter (SPM) is significantly underestimated as shown for examples from various environments (upwelling areas of Peru, Chile and the Gulf of California, the Norwegian Kyllaren fjord and the German Wadden Sea). By correlating Cu/Al and Ni/Al with TOC in the samples the apparent M/Al ratio of the background can be estimated. A prerequisite for this technique is high linearity and high quality of correlation (r(2)>= 0.8) otherwise the lithogenic background cannot be exactly determined. The resulting higher authigenic level of Cu and Ni may promote their use as productivity indicators while the status of Cu and Ni may shift from moderately to highly enriched when the enrichment is assessed via EFs.

Hansbreen, a glacier located close to the Polish Polar Station in southern Svalbard, is a perfect site to study metals and metalloids: it has a complex geological substratum, has a year-round presence of a small group of people, and is near the coast. We analyzed a snapshot of metal and metalloid concentrations in snow samples from shallow cores corresponding to autumn, winter, and spring deposition on Hansbreen. Eighteen cores of snow were collected across the glacier, revealing the influence of potential local sources of metals and metalloids. In these samples, we predominantly found Na, Mg, and K, followed by Zn, Ca, Al, and Fe. Heavy metals, such as Bi or Hg, were also detected. Cluster analysis of the determined elemental concentrations divided them into three distinct groups: Group 1: Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Hg, Mo, Sb, Se, and Zn-the most diverse cluster, representing mostly long-range transported volatile elements, with possible extra local geological sources; Group 2: Al, Fe, Cu, and Mn-elements with crustal sources; and Group 3: Na, Ca, Mg, K, and Sr-with the main source in sea spray aerosol.

Trace metals (Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb), major ions, alkalinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, water temperature and electric conductivity were also measured. Major ions were mainly controlled by chemical weathering intensity and reaction types, while trace metals were influenced by both chemical weathering and physicochemical control upon their mobility. Indeed, we found that Br & oslash;ggerbreen was dominated by carbonate weathering via carbonation of carbonate, while Austre Lov & eacute;nbreen and Pedersenbreen were dominated by sulfide oxidation coupled with carbonate dissolution with a doubled silicate weathering. The higher enrichment of trace metals in supraglacial meltwater compared to ice marginal and proglacial meltwater suggested anthropogenic pollution from atmospheric deposition.

Principal component and classification analysis (PCCA) ordination revealed that mosses of Spitsbergen were distinguished by a significantly higher Na concentration of marine spray origin and mosses of Karkonosze were distinguished by significantly higher concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Li, Mn, Pb, V, and Zn probably from long-range atmospheric transport. The influence of the polar station with a waste incinerator resulted in significantly higher Co, Li, and Ni concentrations in neighbouring mosses in comparison with this species from other sites. This investigation contributes to the use of R. lanuginosum as a bioindicator for metal contamination in Arctic and alpine tundra regions characterised by severe climate habitats with a restricted number of species. This moss enables the control of pollution usually brought solely by long-range atmospheric transport in high mountains as well as in Arctic areas.",2018,,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,25,13,12444-12450,WOS:000431883500023,10.1007/s11356-018-1508-2,,#250,Wojtun 2018,,biota; primary source; terrestrial

"SOME HEAVY-METALS, ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS, AND CHLORINATED HYDROCARBONS IN POLAR BEAR (URSUS-MARITIMUS) AT SVALBARD","NORHEIM, G; SKAARE, JU; WIIG, O","During the period 1978-1989, samples of liver, kidney and subcutaneous fat from 24 polar bears, Ursus maritimus, from Svalbard were analysed for mercury, cadmium, lead, copper, zinc, selenium, arsenic, HCB, DDE, and PCBs (as Aroclor 1260R or Phenoclor DP6R). In a selected number of liver (seven) and fat (three) samples, the composition of individual PCB congeners was studied by comparison with 23 individual PCB congeners (IUPAC nos. 28, 52, 74, 101, 99, 110, 149, 118, 114, 105, 153, 141, 138, 187, 128, 183. 156, 157, 180, 170, 194,206 and 209). In the seven liver samples, the concentrations of o,p'- and p,p'-isomers of DDT, TDE, DDE, alpha-, beta- and gamma-HCH, oxychlordane, heptachlor, heptachlorepoxide, aldrin and dieldrin were also determined. The hepatic concentrations of mercury, cadmium and lead in animals of all ages were 0.4-6.0, < 0.1-1.2, and < 0.5-1.6-mu-g g-1, respectively. This indicates a moderate exposure. Concentrations of mercury and selenium were correlated (r = 0.80). The levels of copper and zinc represented nor-mal physiological concentrations. The concentrations of HCB, DDE and PCBs in fat were < 0.05-1.5, < 0.1-3.4 and 2.9-90-mu-g g-1, respectively. The corresponding results for liver were < 0.01-0.11, < 0.1-0.5 and 0.1-78-mu-g g-1, respectively. Six PCB congeners, PCB-99, -153, -138, -180, -170 and -194 accounted for about 99 and 87% of the total PCB content (sum of the 12 congeners, nos. 28, 99, 153, 138, 128 + 187, 156, 157, 180, 170, 194, 206 and 209) in liver and fat, respectively. PCB-153 represented 37 +/- 3 and 30 +/- 16% of the sum PCB (sum of 12 congeners) in liver and fat, respectively. The range of the hepatic concentration of oxychlordane was 5-19-mu-g g-1. Quantifiable concentrations of heptachlor, heptachlorepoxide, beta-HCH and dieldrin were also found in all the liver samples analysed. Low concentrations of p,p'- and o,p'-DDT were found in two of seven liver and two of two fat samples. Comparisons are made with investigations from Canada and Greenland. Possible effects of PCBs, especially on reproduction, cannot be excluded. Ringed seal, Foca hispida, and to some extent bearded seal, Erignathus barbatus, are the main food of the polar bear. It is therefore likely that the exposure to environmental pollutants occurs via the consumption of these two species.",1992,,ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,77,1,51-57,WOS:A1992HW54700007,10.1016/0269-7491(92)90157-6,,#272,NORHEIM 1992,,Cu biology; biota; marine; pre-2010; primary source
Applying foraminiferal stratigraphy as a biomarker for heavy metal contamination and mining impact in a fiord in West Greenland,"Elberling, B; Knudsen, KL; Kristensen, PH; Asmund, G","Sulphidic mine waste disposed in marine environments constitutes an environmental risk to aquatic life due to potential uptake and accumulation of heavy metals in biota. Fiord sediments near the former Black Angel Mine in West Greenland are contaminated by lead and zinc as a result of submarine tailings disposal in 1973-1990. In 1999 cores were taken up to 10 km away from the disposal area. Analyses include heavy metals, radiochemical dating (Pb-210) and high-resolution foraminiferal stratigraphy. The mining operation resulted in significant changes in the assemblage composition. In addition, up to 20% of the Melonis barleeanus population found in sediment deposited during nearby tailings disposal was deformed compared to a natural background of less than 5%. Throughout cores representing the last 100 years of sedimentation, the total numbers and frequency of morphological abnormalities among M. barleeanus revealed some correlation with heavy metals concentrations (up to r(2) = 79%). We conclude that abnormalities among foraminifera may represent a useful biomarker for evaluating trends in the biological impact resulting of submarine tailings disposal as well as long-term environmental impact and subsequent recovery.

Speciation of trace elements in discharges from the pulp industry,"Skipperud, L; Salbu, B; Hagebo, E","The concentrations and size distribution pattern of trace elements in wastewater discharged from a pulp industry located at Oslo Fjord, Norway, have been studied. The annual discharge to the fjord amounts to approx. 34 kg Cd, 18 kg Ce, 15 kg Co, 10 kg Cs, 1500 kg Cu, 8200 kg Fe, 150 kg Ni, 420 kg Pb, 1100 kg Rb, 1.2 kg Sc, 3 kg Sm, 5100 kg Sr and 3500 kg Zn. Information on the size-distribution pattern of the trace elements in discharged waste water was obtained using the tangential cross-flow ultrafiltration technique. Instrumental neutron activation analysis, INAA, was employed to determine the concentration levels of Cd, Ce, Co, Cs, Eu, Fe, La, Rb, Sc, Sm, Sr and Zn. Lead, Cu and Ni were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy with graphite furnace, GFAAS, and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, ICP-AES. Almost all of the alkali metals Cs and Rb, the alkaline earth metal Sr and also Ni in discharged waste water were found to be present in the low molecular weight fraction. A major fraction of Co, Cu and Pb was present in the low molecular weight fraction, while a significant fraction was found as colloids, particles or both. Cadmium, Fe and Zn in discharge waste water were predominantly present as colloids. Approx. 50% of Sc was present as particles, 100% of Ce was present as particles, and most of the Sm was found as colloids. Due to coastal currents and trace element background levels in coastal water, the contribution of mobile trace elements to Norwegian coastal sea water is probably of minor importance provided that wood from highly contaminated areas is not utilised in the pulp industry. If the particle fraction accumulates outside the outlet, however, a local environmental impact over the years should be expected. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Occurrence of matrix-bound phosphine in polar ornithogenic tundra ecosystems: Effects of alkaline phosphatase activity and environmental variables,"Zhu, RB; Ma, DW; Ding, W; Bai, B; Liu, YS; Sun, JJ","Phosphine (PH3), a reduced phosphorus compound, is a highly toxic and reactive atmospheric trace gas. In this study, a total of ten ornithogenic soil/sediment profiles were collected from tundra ecosystems of east Antarctica and Arctic, and matrix-bound phosphine (MBP), the phosphorus fractions and alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) were analyzed. High MBP concentrations were found in these profiles with the range from 39.59 ng kg(-1) dw to 11.77 mu g kg(-1) dw. MBP showed a consistent vertical distribution pattern in almost all the soil profiles, and its concentrations increased at soil surface layers and then decreased with depths. MBP levels in the ornithogenic soils were two to three orders of magnitude lower than those in ornithogenic sediments. The yield of PH3 as a fraction of total P in all the profiles ranged from 10(-5) to 10(-9) mgPH(3) mg(-1)P with higher mean PH3 yield in the ornithogenic sediments. The ornithogenic soils showed high concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), organic phosphorus (OP), inorganic phosphorus (IP) and metal elements (Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe, Al and Ca) but low MBP levels, vice versa for the ornithogenic sediments. No correlation had been obtained between MBP concentrations and IP, OP and TP. There existed an exponential correlation (r=0.67, p<0.01) between MBP and soil/sediment moisture. MBP concentrations showed a significant positive correlation with APA (r=0.668, p<0.0001), total organic carbon (r=0.501, p<0.0001), total hydrogen (r=0.483, p<0.0001) and total sulfur (r=0.398, p<0.001), indicating that the production of MBP is associated with microbially mediated factors rather than the contents of TP, IP and OP in the P-enriched ornithogenic soils/sediments. Our results indicated that MBP is an important gaseous link in the phosphorus biogeochemical cycles of ornithogenic tundra ecosystems in Antarctica and Arctic. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Field contamination of the starfish Asterias rubens by metals.: Part 1:: Short- and long-term accumulation along a pollution gradient,"Coteur, G; Pernet, P; Gillan, D; Joly, G; Maage, A; Dubois, P","The accumulation of Cd, Pb, Zn, and Cu in the starfish Asterias rubens was studied in a Norwegian fjord characterized by a gradient of metal pollution in the sediments, ranging from very high metal concentrations at its head to much lower levels at its opening. The concentrations of metals in starfish from natural populations along the gradient (long-term accumulation) and in starfish that were transferred up the gradient (short-term accumulation) were compared. At long-term, Cd and Pb accumulations by starfish living at normal salinity (30parts per thousand) were related to the level of contamination of the environment while Cu and, to a lesser extent, Zn accumulations appeared strictly controlled. At short-term, Pb was accumulated steadily, Cd and Zn were accumulated transiently in the pyloric caeca (fast compartment), and Cu was not accumulated at all. Depuration experiments (transfer down the gradient) showed that Cd and Pb were efficiently eliminated from the pyloric caeca but not from the body wall (slow compartment). It is concluded that Pb is chronically accumulated, without apparent control, Cd is subjected to a regulating mechanism in the pyloric. caeca which is overwhelmed over the long-term; Zn is tightly controlled in the pyloric caeca and Cu in both pyloric caeca and body wall. A distinct color variety of starfish is restricted to the low salinity (22-26parts per thousand) superficial water layer. This variety showed a different pattern of metal accumulation over the long-term. This pattern is attributed to the particular hydrological conditions prevailing in this upper layer.",2003,,ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,22,9,2136-2144,WOS:000185639400025,10.1897/02-489,,#282,Coteur 2003,,biota; marine; pre-2010; primary source
Car Tire Crumb Rubber: Does Leaching Produce a Toxic Chemical Cocktail in Coastal Marine Systems?,"Halsband, C; Sorensen, L; Booth, AM; Herzke, D","Crumb rubber granulate (CRG) produced from end of life tires (ELTs) is commonly applied to synthetic turf pitches (STPs), playgrounds, safety surfaces and walkways. In addition to fillers, stabilizers, cross-linking agents and secondary components (e.g., pigments, oils, resins), ELTs contain a range of other organic compound and heavy metal additives. While previous environmental impact studies on CRG have focused on terrestrial soil and freshwater ecosystems, many sites applying CRG in Norway are coastal. The current study investigated the organic chemical and metal additive content of 'pristine' and 'weathered' CRG and their seawater leachates, as well as uptake and effects of leachate exposure using marine copepods (AcartiaandCalanussp.). A combination of pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (py-GC-MS) and chemical extraction followed by GC-MS analysis revealed similar organic chemical profiles for pristine and weathered CRG, including additives such as benzothiazole,N-1,3-dimethylbutyl-N '-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine and a range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and phenolic compounds (e.g., bisphenols). ICP-MS analysis revealed g kg(-1) quantities of Zn and mg kg(-1)quantities of Fe, Mn, Cu, Co, Cr, Pb, and Ni in the CRG. A cocktail of organic additives and metals readily leached from the CRG into seawater, with the most abundant leachate components being benzothiazole and Zn, Fe, Co (metals), as well as detectable levels of PAHs and phenolic compounds. Concentrations of individual components varied with CRG source material and CRG to seawater ratio, but benzothiazole and Zn were typically the organic and metal components present at the highest concentrations in the leachates. While organic chemical concentrations in the leachates stabilized within days, metals continued to leach out over the 30-day period. Marine copepods exposed to high CRG leachate concentrations exhibited high mortalities within 48 h. The smaller lipid-poorAcartiahad a higher sensitivity to leachates than the larger lipid-richCalanus, indicating species-specific differences in vulnerability to leachates. The effect on survival was alleviated at lower leachate concentrations, indicating a dose-response relationship. Benzothiazole and its derivatives appear to be of concern owing to their proven toxicity, while bisphenols are also known to be toxic and were enriched in the leachates relative to the other compounds in the CRG.",2020,,FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,8,,,WOS:000560307900001,10.3389/fenvs.2020.00125,,#287,Halsband 2020,"Sam Welch (2025-07-18 18:24:12)(Select): this is technically a lab/effects study, but to my eye they show Cu leaching from tire crumb rubber to seawater, so it's probably relevant ; ",biota; marine; terrestrial
"Applying Chemometrics to Determine Dispersion of Mine Tailing-Affected Sediments from Submarine Tailing Disposal in Bokfjorden, Northern Norway","Simonsen, AMT; Pedersen, KB; Bach, L; Sternal, B; Junttila, J; Elberling, B","Mine tailing management is one of the largest environmental issues related to mining operation. This study uses chemometrics to assess the dispersion of iron mine tailing-affected sediments in Bokfjorden, Northern Norway. Metal concentrations (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) and physico-chemical sediment characteristics (conductivity, organic matter, sulphate, chloride, grain size, CaCO3, pH) were analysed in seven sediment cores collected in a transect out of the fjord along with two reference cores. Results of hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis allowed to distinguish between mine tailing-affected and non-affected sediments. Non-affected sediments were especially characterised by high levels of organic matter whilst mine tailing-affected sediments varied significantly in sediment characteristics depending on location in the fjord. Crucial parameters to reveal mine tailing-affected sediments varied between the target metal Fe along with metals of Cd and Mn, albeit less significant. Variations in mine tailing-affected sediment characteristics could be attributed to other anthropogenic activities in the fjord. Despite potential disturbances, chemometrics made it possible to identify dispersion of mine tailing-affected sediments to cover the inner and middle parts of the fjord. The study demonstrates the advantage of applying chemometrics on complex fjord systems, which in this case was used to distinguish mine tailing-affected sediments from areas with elevated levels of metals not necessarily related to the mine.",2018,,WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION,229,6,,WOS:000435497500024,10.1007/s11270-018-3868-0,,#295,Simonsen 2018,,Cu environmental chemistry; marine; primary source; sediment
"Evaluation of the use of common sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius) organ histology as bioindicator for element exposure in the fjord of the mining area Maarmorilik, West Greenland","Sonne, C; Bach, L; Sondergaard, J; Riget, FF; Dietz, R; Mosbech, A; Leifsson, PS; Gustayson, K","The former Black Angel lead zinc mine in Maarmorilik, West Greenland, is a historic example of how mining activity may result in a significant impact on the surrounding fjord system in terms of elevated concentrations of especially lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) in seawater, sediments and surrounding biota. In order to shed light on the present contamination and possible effects in the fjord we initiated a range of studies including a pilot study on gill and liver morphology of common sculpins (Myoxocephalus scorpius) around Maarmorilik. Sculpins were caught and sampled at five different stations known to represent a gradient of Pb concentrations. Fish livers from all specimens were analyzed for relevant elements in the area: Fe, Zn, As, Cu, Se, Cd, Pb, Ag, Hg, Co and Ni. Lead, As and Hg showed significant differences among the five stations. For 20% of the sculpins, Hg concentrations were in the range of lowest observed effect dose (LOED) of 0.1-0.5 mu g/g ww for toxic threshold on reproduction and subclinical endpoints. Likewise LOEDs for tissue lesions, LOEDs for biochemistry, growth, survival and reproduction were exceeded for Cd (0.42-1.8 mu g/g ww) and for As (11.6 mu g/g ww) in 28% and 85% of the sculpins, respectively. Similar to this, the no observed effect dose (NOED) for biochemistry was exceeded for Pb (0.32 mu g/g ww) and for growth, mortality and reproduction for Zn (60-68 mu g/g ww) in 33% and 24% of the sculpins, respectively. For all sculpins, females were significantly larger than males and for five of the elements (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Se) females had higher concentrations. The chronic lesions observed in liver (mononuclear cell infiltrates, necrosis, vacuolar hepatocytes, portal fibrosis, bile duct hyperplasia, active melanomacrophage centers) and gills (fusion and edema of secondary lamellae, laminar telangiectasis, mononuclear cell infiltrates, blebs) were similar to those in the literature studies for both wild and laboratory exposed sculpins and other fish species carrying similar or higher Hg concentrations. Ignoring sex and size, specimens with hepatic cell infiltrates had the highest concentrations of most elements, a relation that was also found for gill telangiectasis and Hg (all p < 0.05). When controlling for sex and size, the prevalence of vacuolar hepatocytes and endoparasites was significantly highest at the three most contaminated stations and similar differences were found for liver necrosis. We suggest that beside exposure to mining-related elements, other environmental factors, such as parasites, might be co-factors in the development of the observed liver and gill lesions. Therefore, sculpin liver and gill pathology are likely to be suitable health indicators when biomonitoring gradients of mining and other element related activity effects; while a larger study is required to fully evaluate the relationships.

Evaluation of trace metal toxicokinetics in Greenland Sea copepod and amphipod collectives from semi-static experiments on board ship,"Ritterhoff, J; Zauke, GP","Semi-static toxicokinetic experiments were performed during a cruise of RV ''Polarstern'' to the Greenland Sea for Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn in mesozooplankton collectives of Calanus hyperboreus, C. finmarchicus, Metridia longa and Themisto abyssorum, to provide first tentative information on accumulation strategies and the experimental basis for estimation of kinetic parameters of two-compartment models. This is an inevitable precondition for using these organisms as biomonitors. Our results indicate a net accumulation strategy for Cu and Pb (within the given experimental constraints), but a tendency for regulation of Zn and especially for Cd. Two-compartment models were successfully fitted to the data, leading to rate constants statistically different from zero, which were validated by independent experiments. An extrapolation to field conditions is not possible without further evaluation. The collectives investigated may be regarded as potentially suitable biomonitors of Cu and Pb, but probably not of Zn and Cd. More information is required for a wider range of external metal exposures and the potential influences of life-history status on metal toxicokinetics must be clarified, before this approach can be fully adopted in the assessment of environmental quality.",1997,,POLAR BIOLOGY,17,3,242-250,WOS:A1997WJ46800007,10.1007/s003000050128,,#324,Ritterhoff 1997,,Cu biology; biota; lab study; marine; pre-2010; primary source
"Potential influence of rapid climate change on elemental geochemistry distributions in lacustrine sediments-A case study at a high Arctic site in Ny-Alesund, Svalbard","Yang, ZK; Zhang, YA; Xie, ZQ; Wang, J; Li, ZL; Li, YQ; Du, JL; Sun, LG","Metal contamination has become an increasingly severe environmental issue due to intense anthropogenic activities in recent decades. Many studies have reported a rapidly increasing trend of heavy metal contents in sedimentary records. In this study, two lacustrine sediment cores (LDL and YL) far away from scientific research stations were collected in Ny-Alesund and analyzed for the vertical distributions of 17 elemental concentrations (Cu, Zn, Pb, Co, Ni, Cr, Sr, Ba, Mn, P, Ti, K2O, Na2O, CaO, MgO, Fe2O3, Al2O3), CIA and TOC contents. The results indicated that only the proxies Pb, P, CaO, TOC, and CIA showed an increasing trend in the upper 7 cm section of the sediment cores, while most of the elements' concentrations decreased towards the surface. The rapid increase of TOC contents is likely related to the climate warming over the past 200 years, which promotes the prosperity of vegetation and thus leads to more input of organic matter into the lakes. Moreover, a large number of seabirds live around the sampling position and the seabird guano contains high concentrations of P, which could be regarded as an important nutrient source for vegetation. Additionally, the rapid climate warming could accelerate the chemical weathering rates, and thus lead to increased CaO contents in the sediment profiles according to its geological background. Therefore, the concentrations of other elements are very likely diluted by the high contents of organic matter and CaO in the upper part of the sediment cores. It is noteworthy that the rapidly increasing trend of Pb contents are related to the gas-oil powered generators in Ny-Alesund and long-range atmospheric transport from Europe. This study highlighted the nonnegligible influence of climate warming on the inorganic elemental geochemistry distributions in remote lakes. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

"Metal residues, histopathology and presence of parasites in the liver and gills of fourhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus quadricornis) and shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius) near a former lead-zinc mine in East Greenland","Dang, M; Norregaard, R; Bach, L; Sonne, C; Sondergaard, J; Gustavson, K; Aastrup, P; Nowak, B","Fourhorn sculpins (Myoxocephalus quadricornis) and shorthorn sculpins (Myoxocephalus scorpius) have been considered suitable local bioindicators for environmental monitoring studies in the Arctic. Because these species share many characteristics, data from the two species have previously been pooled when assessing marine metal contamination. A chemical and histological study was conducted on fourhorn and shorthorn sculpins collected around a contaminated lead-zinc mine at East Greenland to investigate whether there were any differences in the residues of metals, histopathology and parasites in liver and gills between the two sculpin species. The results demonstrated that concentrations of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) were significantly higher in the fourhorn sculpins (p < 0.001) while there were no significant differences for arsenic (As) or cadmium (Cd). Furthermore, density of blood vessel fibrosis (p=0.028), prevalence and density of chondroplasia (p=0.002 and p=0.005, respectively), number of mucin-containing mucous cells (p < 0.001) and chloride cells (p < 0.001) and mean intensity of colonial Peritricha (p < 0.001) were significantly higher in fourhorn sculpin.

Trace elements in alpine and arctic lake sediments as a record of diffuse atmospheric contamination across Europe,"Camarero, L; Botev, I; Muri, G; Psenner, R; Rose, N; Stuchlik, E","P> We surveyed the distribution of several trace elements in contemporary and pre-industrial sediment s in 275 lakes in alpine and arctic lake districts across Europe including the Pyrenees, Alps, the Rila Mountains, Retezat, Julian Alps, Tatras, Scottish mountains, Central Norway and Greenland.Sediment cores were collected at the deepest part of each lake and analysed at two depths (surface sediment and at 15-17 cm depth) for Ti, Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, As, Hg and Se.The concentrations of trace elements found in the lakes included in the survey are comparable to those reported in aquatic sediments receiving higher contamination loads. With the exception of Greenland, a large percentage of lakes showed enrichment factors for most elements well above 1.5, indicating atmospheric contamination. The influence of contamination has increased the co-distribution of trace elements in sediments, with the exception of As.Pb is the element that shows the highest contamination level at the European scale, followed by Hg and As. Zn, Cd, Cu and Se contamination is detectable to a lower degree.The Tatra Mountains and Scotland seem to be most affected. Natural mechanisms leading to the formation of highly organic, metal-binding sediments may be the cause of the high levels in Scotland, whereas those in the Tatras appear to be due to elevated deposition.The Retezat and Central Norway appear to be least polluted.In the Alps, enrichments in Pb, Hg and Zn are higher in southern than in central areas suggesting a flux of these pollutants from the south. In the Pyrenees, the high natural levels of As are remarkable.

Elemental analysis of soils and Salix polaris in the town of Pyramiden and its surroundings (Svalbard),"Krajcarová, L; Novotny, K; Chattová, B; Elster, J","The contents of elements in the top soil (upper 5 cm) and deeper soil (5 to 10 cm) layers and in Salix polaris (leaves and stem) from the former Soviet mining town of Pyramiden and its close vicinity on the Svalbard archipelago were determined. The analyses covered major and trace elements, including heavy metals, in order to describe anthropogenic impacts related to the management of the mining town. Soil samples and plant tissues were analysed from 13 localities across and close to town vicinity. The plant ground cover of all sampling points was determined, and plant tissues (leaves and stem) were collected. Higher contents of Cd (3-11 mg kg(-1)) and Mo (11-33 mg kg(-1)) were detected in the soils. With relation to the world average concentration of metals in soils, the geo-accumulation indexes (I-geo) and the level of pollution of the analysed soils were classified into seven pollution grades. The soils of the studied localities were usually unpolluted (grade 1) when analysed for metals, with the soil pollution grades 4-6 identified only for Cd and Mo (moderately to strongly polluted). In Salix polaris, excessive amounts of Fe (60-1520 mg kg(-1)), Zn (80-1050 mg kg(-1)), Cd (0.2-5.5 mg kg(-1)) and Cr (0-3.6 mg kg(-1)) were observed. The I-geo of these elements, compared with values considered sufficient for plants, showed pollution grades from 2 to 6. The pollution load index (PLI) ranged between 0.49 and 1.01. Only one locality could be considered polluted having a PLI higher than 1. Plant/soil transfer factors (TF) for trace metals decreased in the following order: Zn > Cu > Cd > Mn > Ni > As > Mo > Pb > Co > Al > Cr > Fe. The principal contribution of this study consists in the assessment of the contamination of soils and plants by toxic heavy metals in an otherwise pristine environment of the Svalbard archipelago related to urban/industrial activities.",2016,,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,23,10,10124-10137,WOS:000376421400081,10.1007/s11356-016-6213-4,,#353,Krajcarová 2016,,biota; primary source; terrestrial
"Metal accumulation and metallothionein in brown trout, Salmo trutta, from two Norwegian rivers differently contaminated with Cd, Cu and Zn","Olsvik, PA; Gundersen, P; Andersen, RA; Zachariassen, KE","In this work we have studied the accumulation of heavy metals in two brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations in their natural environment and the participation of metal binding to metallothionein (MT) in this process. Cd, Cu and Zn concentrations, total MT (including Cu MT) and Cd/Zn MT were measured in the gills, liver and kidney of trout inhabiting two rivers, one Cu-contaminated and the other Cd/Zn-contaminated, located at Roros, Central Norway. In both populations, high levels of Cu were found in the liver, whereas Cd was accumulated in liver and particularly in the kidney. The proportions of Cd/Zn MT and Cu MT in liver and kidney, but not in gills, reflected the accumulated and the environmental concentrations of these metals. The total. Cu MT concentrations in the investigated tissues, however, were highest in trout from the river with the lowest ambient Cu concentration. It is suggested that MTs are of less importance in Cu-acclimated trout. The data also suggest that acclimation to a Cu-rich environment involves reduced Cu accumulation or increased Cu elimination. In trout from the Cd-rich environment, this metal was mainly bound to MT, whereas in trout from the Cu-rich environment Cd was also associated with non-MT proteins. These findings emphasize the importance to determine both Cd/Zn MT and Cu MT levels, when the participation of this protein in metal handling in trout tissues is investigated.

Gill metal binding and stress gene transcription in brown trout (Salmo trutta) exposed to metal environments:: The effect of pre-exposure in natural populations,"Hansen, BH; Garmo, OA; Olsvik, PA; Andersen, RA","Brown trout (Salmo trutta) from two native populations from the Roros area in Central Norway, acclimated in mining-affected habitats to different levels of Cd/Zn and Cu, together with trout from a nearby unaffected river (reference) were transferred to a nearby lake with higher levels of Cu, Cd, and Zn than those in their respective native rivers. This experiment was conducted to gain information about the underlying resistance mechanisms developed in fish exposed to metal environments. The focus was on gill metal accumulation and transcription of the metal-responsive stress genes metallothionein-A (MT-A), Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70). The only shared response shown between the three groups after transfer were Cu accumulation and MT-A induction. The Cu-acclimated trout produced mucus to reduce the uptake of Cu into the gills. The MT-A levels were highest in the Cd/Zn-acclimated trout both before and after transfer. Before transfer, antioxidant transcription (SOD and GPx) was higher in gills of Cu-acclimated compared to the Cd/Zn-acclimated trout, but increased transcription of antioxidant stress genes was observed after transfer in both metal-acclimated groups. The metal-acclimated trout groups also showed an increase in the transcription of HSP-70. Compared to the reference population not previously exposed to metals, stress gene transcription increased faster in the metal-acclimated populations. The exception was induction of CAT, which appeared to be depressed after transfer in Cd/Zn-acclimated trout. The data indicate that acclimation to chronic metal exposure involves different strategies to cope with different metals and that these strategies involve both physiological mechanisms (mucus production) as well as metal-related stress gene transcription.",2007,,ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,26,5,944-953,WOS:000245749500016,10.1897/06-380R.1,,#360,Hansen 2007,Sam Welch (2025-07-11 21:17:10)(Screen): principally biomarker study but may be worthwhile if include tissue concentrations; ,biota; effects study; pre-2010
Monitoring strategies for re-establishment of ecological reference conditions: Possibilities and limitations,"Alve, E; Lepland, A; Magnusson, J; Backer-Owe, K","The ecological status of an environment should be evaluated by comparison with local ""reference conditions"", here defined as the pre-industrial ecological status of the 19th century. This pilot study illustrates how micropalaeontological monitoring, using benthic foraminifera (protists) and associated geochemical parameters preserved in inner Oslofjord (Norway) sediments, characterise local reference conditions. In order to optimise the usefulness of the ecological information held by foraminifera and enable characterisation of temporal changes in environmental quality beyond time intervals covered by biological time-series, the Norwegian governmental macrofauna-based classification system is applied on fossil benthic foraminiferal assemblages. Quantitative comparisons demonstrate deteriorating ecological status in response to increased anthropogenic forcing (eutrophication, micropollutants), including a 73% loss in number of foraminiferal species. Despite reduced pollution during the past decades and, at one site, capping of polluted sediments with clean clay, the reference conditions are far from re-established. Micropalaeontological monitoring requires net sediment accumulation basins and careful considerations of taphonomic processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"Transport of Air Masses and Pollutants to the Russian Arctic Islands (1986-2016): Long-Term, Interannual, and Seasonal Variations","Vinogradova, AA; Ivanova, YA","The Arctic is the most important, as well as the most vulnerable, region in the Northern Hemisphere with respect to climate changes. It is natural that climate changes observed on the globe in recent decades affect the environment in northern regions and processes determining climate. An analysis of time variations in these processes is important in understanding observed phenomena and in estimating their possible consequences. In this work, 30-year data series on the frequency of air-mass transport from Europe, Asia, and North America to the Arctic archipelagos of Franz Josef Land and Severnaya Zemlya and Wrangel Island have been analyzed, and statistical regularities observed in atmospheric-circulation processes in different seasons have been studied using atmospheric-circulation indices. The atmospheric concentrations of anthropogenic heavy metals (HMs) and their fluxes onto the surface of the Russian Arctic islands have been analyzed. The frequency of air-mass transport to the Russian Arctic from the continents has decreased over the last 30 years. Therefore, the composition of the atmosphere and precipitation over the Arctic becomes more and more maritime, which may affect variations in the properties of surface natural objects such as soil, water, vegetation, etc. Interannual variations in atmospheric-circulation processes are wide, which results in wide interannual variations in the atmospheric concentrations of anthropogenic HMs and their fluxes onto the surface. This also explains interannual variations in the content of HMs accumulated in the snow cover every year during the snowy season. Within some months and years, the maximum concentrations of nickel and copper in the air and snow cover of the Arctic islands may reach their concentration levels observed in less remote regions on the mainland. On the other hand, there are years, when no anthropogenic pollutants are transported to the Russian Arctic islands during the summer months. The main reason for seasonal variations in the concentrations of anthropogenic pollutants in the Arctic regions is in seasonal variations in the rate of precipitation of HMs onto the surface during their long-range transport.",2018,,IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS,54,7,688-699,WOS:000454419000007,10.1134/S0001433818070174,,#365,Vinogradova 2018,,air; marine; terrestrial
Heavy metal content in liver and kidneys of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in various life stages correlated with metallothionein levels:: Some metal-binding characteristics of this protein,"Teigen, SW; Andersen, RA; Daae, HL; Skaare, JU","Liver and kidneys from grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in their natural habitats in Norwegian waters contain high levels of Cd and Hg as well as metallothionein (MT). The data show significant placental transfer of heavy metals in seals. The MT concentrations were higher in fetus liver and kidneys than in the liver and kidneys of juveniles and adults. A significantly higher proportion of the total Cd and Cu, as compared to Zn and Hg, in fetal liver was associated with MT. Only low amounts of metals and MT were found in juveniles. In kidneys, little metal was associated with MT, although high amounts of Cd were bound in fetal stages. Positive correlations were found between total metal, MT content, and MT-bound metals, particularly for Cd and Zn. Grey seal MT may have higher affinity to Zn than to Cd.

"The influence of seabirds on the concentration of selected heavy metals in organic soil on the Bellsund coast, western Spitsbergen","Ziólek, M; Bartminski, P; Stach, A","Seabirds are an important factor affecting the chemical properties of the arctic soil environment. The objective of this work was to study the differences in content and distribution of heavy metals in organic soils resulting from the differential influence of seabirds. Studies were conducted in two stations in the southwest part of Spitsbergen-the first without the influence of seabirds and the second directly affected by an avian colony. Basic properties of soils as well as total content of Ca, Na, Mg, K, Fe, Al, Cu, Zn, Ni, Mn, Pb, Cd, Co, and Cr were determined. Reference was made to the previously published contents of different forms of phosphorus (P) for these locations. The studies showed that Zn, Mn, Cu, and Cd contents were higher in the soils that had been in the vicinity of the seabird colony. High statistically positive correlations of Cd, Cu, and Zn were noted with particular P forms. In the case of Pb, Cr, Co, and Ni content, the seabird influence was not dominant; probably other factors were more relevant (the processes of weathering, denudation, leaching, and atmospheric pollutants transported in the form of dust or gases). Clear segregation was observed of individual positions conditioned by selected soil features and by heavy metals content.",2017,,ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH,49,4,507-520,WOS:000413931200001,10.1657/AAAR0016-024,,#379,Ziólek 2017,,Cu biology; primary source; terrestrial
An integrative biological effects assessment of a mine discharge into a Norwegian fjord using field transplanted mussels,"Brooks, SJ; Escudero-Oñate, C; Gomes, T; Ferrando-Climent, L","The blue mussel (Mytilus sp.) has been used to assess the potential biological effects of the discharge effluent from the Omya Hustadmarmor mine, which releases its tailings into the Fraenfjord near Molde, Norway. Chemical body burden and a suite of biological effects markers were measured in mussels positioned for 8 weeks at known distances from the discharge outlet. The biomarkers used included: condition index (CI); stress on stress (SoS); micronuclei formation (MN); acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibition, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and Neutral lipid (NL) accumulation. Methyl triethanol ammonium (MTA), a chemical marker for the esterquat based flotation chemical (FLOT2015), known to be used at the mine, was detected in mussels positioned 1500m and 2000m downstream from the discharge outlet. Overall the biological responses indicated an increased level of stress in mussels located closest to the discharge outlet. The same biomarkers (MN, SoS, NL) were responsible for the integrated biological response (IBR/n) of the two closest stations and indicates a response to a common point source. The integrated biological response index (IBR/n) reflected the expected level of exposure to the mine effluent, with the highest IBR/n calculated in mussels positioned closest to the discharge. Principal component analysis (PCA) also showed a clear separation between the mussel groups, with the most stressed mussels located closest to the mine tailing outlet. Although not one chemical factor could explain the increased stress on the mussels, highest metal (As, Co, Ni, Cd, Zn, Ag, Cu, Fe) and MTA concentrations were detected in the mussel group located closest to the mine discharge.

Radionuclide and trace metal accumulation in a variety of mosses used as bioindicators for atmospheric deposition,"Ren, X; Wang, JL; Zhong, QQ; Bi, QQ; Zhu, RL; Du, JZ","Mosses can be used as biological monitors to study metal pollution and the depositional fluxes of radionuclides. . . In this study, we analysed the concentrations of radionuclides ((210)pb (Pb-210(ex)), Be-7, Cs-137, K-40, U-238, R-226, Ra-228 and Th-228) and metals (Fe, Zn, Cu, Al, Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, V and Mn) in moss and soil samples from two different regions. The metal concentrations were higher in mainland China than in the Arctic region, and this is likely associated with the comparatively lower rates of industrial production and human activity in the Arctic region. Principal component analysis and correlation results revealed two radionuclides sources types in mosses, i.e., soil (K-40, U-238, Ra-226, Ra-228 and Ra-228) and atmospheric (Pb-210 (Pb-210(ex)), Be-7 Cs-137). Clustering and correlation analyses showed that different sources such as traffic (suspended dust), fossil fuels, dry and wet deposition (atmosphere and rainfall), and soil contributed to metal accumulation in mosses.The correlation between radionuclides and metals supported thew observations, confirmed the accuracy of our results, and suggests that radionuclides are useful for identifying the source of metals in moss samples. The concentration ratios (CR) values of the radionuclides and the bioaccumulation factor (BCF) and enrichment factor (EF) values of metals in mosses helped identify the most environmentally sensitive moss, i.e., BS (Brom paradoxum), which can be used for screening and monitoring radionuclides and metal pollution in urban atmospheres. These results support the use of analysing radionuclides in mosses to identify metal sources, and the potential use of mosses can to determine the atmospheric deposition fluxes of radionuclides.

Do salmon farms increase the concentrations of mercury and other elements in wild fish?,"Bustnes, JO; Nygård, T; Dempster, T; Ciesielski, T; Jenssen, BM; Bjorn, PA; Uglem, I","Earlier assessments have suggested that salmon farms may act as a source of mercury (Hg) and other elements in local marine environments. In this study, we measured 30 elements in the livers of demersal Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and pelagic saithe (Pollachius virens) caught in association with salmon farms (farm associated [FA]; n = 75) or at reference locations (control; n 80) in three regions throughout the latitudinal extent of Norway (59-70 degrees N). Concentrations of most elements (24 of 30) were higher (20-70%) in cod compared to saithe. In particular, Hg was 6.8 times higher in cod than saithe. Nine elements were significantly different between FA saithe and control saithe, but only four (Hg, U, Cr and Mn) were highest in FA saithe, and this pattern was only detected consistently across all locations for Hg. Thirteen elements differed in concentration between FA cod and control cod, but only three elements (U, Al and Ba) were higher in FA cod than controls, and this pattern was only detected consistently across all locations for Al. After controlling for a set of potentially confounding variables, the estimated concentrations of Hg in saithe livers were similar to 80% higher in FA fish compared to controls. In contrast, Hg concentrations were similar to 40% higher in control cod compared to FA cod. Our results do not support the notion that salmon farms in general increase the concentrations of potentially harmful elements in wild fish, and the distribution of Hg and other elements in cod and saithe in Norwegian coastal waters may be more influenced by habitat use, diet, geochemical conditions and water chemistry.",2011,,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING,13,6,1687-1694,WOS:000291403300018,10.1039/c1em10083a,,#403,Bustnes 2011,,biota; marine; primary source
"Accumulation Characteristics of Metals and Metalloids in Plants Collected from Ny-Ålesund, Arctic","Ma, HM; Shi, GT; Cheng, YQ","Toxic elements can be transported to polar regions by long-range atmospheric transport from mid and low latitudes, leading to enrichment of elements in the polar environment, especially in the Arctic. The plants can be ideal bioindicators of element contamination in environments, but information on the element enrichment and sources of plants remains limited in polar regions. Here, concentrations of 15 metals and metalloids (Pb, Ni, Cr, Cu, Co, As, Cd, Sb, Hg, Se, Fe, Zn, Mn, Al, and Ti) in six species of plants, Deschampsia caespitosa (Tufted Hair Grass), Puccinellia phryganodes (Creeping Alkaligrass), Saxifraga aizoides (Yellow Mountain Saxifrage), Dicranum angustum (Dicranum Moss), Salix Polaris (Polar Willow), and Cerastium arcticum (Arctic Mouse-Ear Chickweed), collected from Ny-angstrom lesund, the Arctic, were determined, and enrichment and sources of elements were assessed. Results show that element concentrations vary in different plant species, and element levels in D. angustum and C. arcticum are generally higher. In spatial terms, elevated element concentrations were found near residential areas, while low element levels were present at the sites far from settlement points. Enrichment assessment shows that Cd, Hg, and Zn are the most enriched elements, with enrichment factors above 30, suggesting sources other than soil dust control their concentrations. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the extracted three components can explain 82% of the total variance in element concentrations. The elements Ni, Cr, As, Sb, Fe, Al, Ti, and to a lesser extent Co are highly loaded in PC1, possibly associated with continental crust particles. PC2 is closely correlated with Cd, Se, Mn, Cu, and Zn, while Hg and Pb have high loadings on PC3. The elements highly loaded on PC2 and PC3 are likely associated with pollutants from atmospheric transportation. Together with enrichment assessment, the investigated plants have a great potential for monitoring atmospheric Cd, Hg, and Zn pollution in Ny-angstrom lesund, and D. angustum and D. caespitosa are the more sensitive species. The results would be of significance for monitoring element contamination in the pristine Arctic environments using the bioindicator plants.",2020,,ATMOSPHERE,11,10,,WOS:000584165400001,10.3390/atmos11101129,,#413,Ma 2020,PIERRE  BLEVIN (2025-07-19 05:51:48)(Screen): source to mar eco?; ,Cu biology; biota; primary source; terrestrial
"Metal speciation and bioavailability in acid mine drainage from a high Arctic coal mine waste rock pile: Temporal variations assessed through high-resolution water sampling, geochemical modelling and DGT","Sondergaard, J; Elberling, B; Asmund, G","This study investigates acid mine drainage from an abandoned coal mine waste rock pile in Svalbard (78 degrees N). A trench was dug to collect all water from the pile and water sampled daily to determine temporal variations in runoff chemistry and to calculate the release of dissolved metals (filtered to <0.45 mu m in size) from the pile during the entire period with running water from June to September 2005. Dissolved and 'labile' fractions of 'total' Al, Mn and Cu were quantified in July and August 2006 by using diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT). Further, metal speciation was calculated for both 2005 and 2006 using the chemical equilibrium model WHAM VI. Predictions of the dissolved inorganic metal fraction using WHANI VI agreed fairly well with in situ measurements of 'labile' Al, Mn and Cu using DGT. However, for Al, the model overestimated the observed degree of organic complexation at the highest pH. Observations and model results for 2005 indicate that the highest dissolved metal concentrations, lowest pH, and highest inorganic (readily 'bioavailable') metal fractions occurred during an initial two-week 'spring flush'. In fact, more than 96% of all dissolved metals were predicted to be 'bioavailable' during that period, which is considered affected by a release of pollutants slowly generated and accumulated within the pile during winter, but released upon thawing. Later in the summer period, both dissolved metal concentrations and the fractions considered bioavailable decreased markedly. This study shows that collection/treatment of spring runoff is essential to reduce the environmental impact at the study site. That conclusion is thought to have wider applications and may include waste depositions containing other types of material deposited in cold regions. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Airborne radionuclides and heavy metals in high Arctic terrestrial environment as the indicators of sources and transfers of contamination,"Lokas, E; Zaborska, A; Sobota, I; Gaca, P; Milton, JA; Kocurek, P; Cwanek, A","A survey of airborne radioactive isotopes (Cs-137, Pu-238, Pu239+240, Am-241, and Pb-210) and trace metals (Pb, Cu, Zn, Cd, Fe, Al) in tundra soils and cryoconite hole material sampled from several locations in the Kaffioyra region of Spitsbergen revealed significant variability in spatial concentration. Lithogenic radionuclides (Th-230, Th-232, U-234, U-238) show less variability than the airborne radionuclides because their activity concentrations are controlled by mixing of local material derived from different types of bedrock.Activity ratios of the artificial radionuclides in most cryoconite samples differ from global fallout signatures. The contribution of radionuclides from additional and more specific sources might be enhanced by non-continuous exposure of cryoconite to atmospheric deposition. We assumed that the main source of Pu, which was detected only in cryoconite samples, is derived from nuclear tests and non-exploded weapons-grade material. Approximately one-third of the total observed Pu activity concentration is Pu-238, most likely originating from the SNAP9A satellite re-entry, which was powered by a Pu-238 thermoelectric generator. In samples from Waldemarbreen the influence of glacial local morphology on the capability of cryoconite for trapping and accumulating airborne radionuclides is apparent. Local glacial morphology plays an important role in determining the accumulation of airborne pollutants. Trace metal concentrations in soils were typical or slightly higher than concentrations characteristic for the natural background; the Pb-206/Pb-207 signature was also close to the natural ratio of the parent rocks. Conversely, trace metal concentrations in cryoconite samples (Pb and Cd) were higher than in soil samples and exceeded natural values. Cryoconite is an effective monitor of the spread of artificial radionuclides and heavy metals in their surrounding environment.",2019,,CRYOSPHERE,13,7,2075-2086,WOS:000477775300002,10.5194/tc-13-2075-2019,,#438,Lokas 2019,PIERRE  BLEVIN (2025-07-17 04:15:48)(Screen): Source to marine ecosystem?; ,air; primary source; terrestrial
ATMOSPHERIC TRACE-ELEMENT DEPOSITION - PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS OF ICP-MS DATA FROM MOSS SAMPLES,"BERG, T; ROYSET, O; STEINNES, E; VADSET, M","Data from a Norwegian survey on atmospheric deposition, including 33 elements in 495 moss samples collected in 1990, are presented. The biomonitor moss used was Hylocomium splendens, and the analyses were carried out by ICP-MS. Principal component analysis is used to identify possible sources of the elements determined in the mosses. Dominant factors represent long-range atmospheric transported elements (Bi, Pb, Sb, Mo, Cd, V, As, Zn, Tl, Hg, Ga), windblown mineral particles ( Y, La, Al, Li, U, Th, Ga, Fe, V, Cr), local emission sources (Ni, Cu, Co, and As; Zn, Cd, and Hg; Fe, Cr, and Al), transport from the marine environment (Mg, B, Na, Sr, Ca), and contribution from higher plants (Cs, Rb, Ba, Mn).

"Vegetation monitoring in South-Varanger, Norway - Species composition of ground vegetation and its relation to environmental variables and pollution impact","Aarrestad, PA; Aamlid, D","The area along the Norwegian-Russian border is threatened by air pollution from emission sources on the Kola Peninsula. A permanent network of 78 systematically chosen monitoring sites has been established in eastern Finnmark, Norway. Species abundance data from the ground vegetation have been recorded from 1320 systematically chosen permanent plots inside 66 of these sites, using frequency in subplots and visual estimates of percentage cover. Environmental variables were obtained for the whole site. Multivariate data analysis has been used to describe the variation in the species composition and to study its relation to environmental variables and pollution impact. The analyses show that much of the variation in the species composition, based on average species abundance at the sites, is well explained by different soil and climatic conditions. However, estimated SO2 deposition, Ni, and Cu in the soil, and Ni in Cladina tissue have also been found to be statistically significantly correlated with the variation in the species data, but they explain only a minor part of the variation. The pollution impact over several years may have lead to a reduced lichen cover in the bottom-layer vegetation.

A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ON THE BENTHIC COMMUNITIES OF THE NORWEGIAN CONTINENTAL-SHELF,"OLSGARD, F; GRAY, JS","Multivariate statistical analyses of data on environmental variables and benthic fauna from 14 oil and gas fields obtained from 24 surveys collected between 1985 and 1993 are presented. At all fields oil-based drilling mud was used. The purpose of this study was to investigate contamination gradients, assess effects on benthic fauna both spatially and temporally and to evaluate measures such as diversity indices, indicator species and multivariate analysis techniques in assessment of pollution. Results from analyses of baseline surveys of environmental variables and fauna were characterised by a lack of distinct gradients in station placement, having a typical shot-gun pattern in PCA-, DCA- and MDS-ordination analyses. Likewise there was no consistency in which environmental variables correlated with the fauna. Contamination was assessed using all the physical and chemical data in classification and PCA-ordination analyses. Clear patterns were found using 4 categories, conveniently termed initial, moderate, severe and gross. The categories were usually apparent as rings radiating from the platform. Initial contamination of the outermost areas at most fields was shown as elevated levels of barium and total hydrocarbons (THC) and sometimes also by elevated levels of zinc, copper, cadmium and lead. Three fields were studied in particular and showed contaminated areas of over 100 km(2) (Valhall), over 15 km(2) (Gyda) and over 10 km(2) (Veslefrikk). After a period of 6 to 9 yr contamination had spread, so that nearly all of the outermost stations 2 to 6 km away from the platforms showed evidence of contamination. Thus, the existing sampling design is no longer suitable for assessment of the area contaminated. Effects on the fauna showed, as with contamination, 4 categories. Analyses linking fauna and environmental variables indicated that the effects were mainly related to THC, barium and strontium, but also to metals Like zinc, copper, cadmium and lead, which are all discharged in drill-cuttings. Effects on the fauna closely followed the patterns of contamination with only a few stations at each field that were contaminated not showing effects. Thus the areas showing effects were only slightly less than the areas contaminated. Subsequent to cessation of discharges biodegradation of oil and reduced concentrations of THC were observed. Yet there was an extension of areas where the fauna was affected several years after cessation of drill-cutting discharges. This may indicate that barite and related compounds associated with the discharges also have an environmental impact. However, preliminary results from fields using only water-based mud clearly indicate a reduction in environmental contamination and biological impact, compared to effects reported here, for oil-based drill-cuttings. Diversity indices applied to the data did not show the extent of effects and such indices alone should not be used to interpret changes. The consistent patterns that the multivariate techniques were able to detect showed that these methods were far superior. Analyses of the initial effects on the fauna showed that there were no consistent patterns in changes in species composition over fields or time, and thus the search for 'universal' sensitive indicator species does not seem to be rewarding. Yet under gross effects of pollution there were consistent patterns with the same species dominating.Finally, the initial effects of pollution included severe reductions in organisms that are key components of the benthic communities and also food for bottom-living fish, and are thus ecologically important.The new fauna which establishes in the contaminated sediments close to platforms, often with high abundance, will probably be less valuable as a food source for fish populations since it is of small size and lives sub-surface.",1995,,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,122,01-Mar,277-306,WOS:A1995RH67200025,10.3354/meps122277,,#464,OLSGARD 1995,,marine; pre-2010; primary source

Occurrence and chemical characteristics of microplastic paint flakes in the North Atlantic Ocean.,Turner A; Ostle C; Wootton M,"Non-fibrous microplastics sampled by the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) Survey throughout the North Atlantic Ocean during 2018 have been recorded and a selection (n = 17, or 16.7%) physically and chemically characterised. The average abundance of non-fibrous particles captured by the plankton silks and detectable by microscopy was estimated to be around 0.01 m(-3), with the highest concentrations evident in shelf seas of northwest Europe. Amongst the samples analysed, median size was 180 μm and, based on visible properties (e.g., brittleness, layering) and infra-red spectra, all but one were identified as flakes of paint. Semi-quantitative analysis by energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry with a collimated beam revealed that six flakes from European shelf seas were Cu-based antifouling formulations (without evidence of organo-Sn compounds), and five with a broader geographical distribution were Pb-based formulations of likely marine origin.

Metals and other trace elements in plasma and feathers of seabirds breeding in Svalbard.,Lundgren SS; Abbasi NA; Waugh CA; Lee MM; Ciesielski TM; Gabrielsen GW; Descamps S; Jaspers VLB,"We assessed the concentrations of metals and other trace elements in two of the most common seabird species breeding on Svalbard, the black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) and the Brünnich's guillemot (Uria lomvia). Both of these species feed mostly on fish and crustaceans but have different foraging strategies, kittiwakes being surface feeders while guillemots are divers. We investigated the concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) in the plasma and body feathers of black-legged kittiwakes (n = 17), as well as in the body feathers of Brünnich's guillemots (n = 13). Samples were collected from adult birds at two time points, one week apart during July 2017 in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. Of the non-essential trace elements, As was found at the highest median concentration at both the first (56.23 ng/g ww) and second (39.99 ng/g ww) sampling timepoints in the kittiwake plasma. When separating for the sexes, as well as sampling time, males sampled at the first sampling time point had significantly higher concentrations of As (median at 0.087 ng/g versus 0.039 ng/g) and Se (median 0.26 ng/g versus 0.16 ng/g) compared to males sampled at the second time point. There was no significant difference in plasma concentrations between females at first and second sampling time points. Kittiwake feathers contained significantly higher concentrations of As, Cd and Hg than guillemot feathers, while guillemot feathers had significantly higher concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn. However, of the non-essential elements in both kittiwake and guillemot feathers Hg was found with the highest median concentrations at 5160 and 1080 ng/g, respectively, thus in kittiwakes exceeding the level of 5000 ng/g associated with adverse effect (e.g., impaired reproduction).

Spatial distribution and risk assessment of metal(loid)s in marine sediments in the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea.,Zheng H; Ren Q; Zheng K; Qin Z; Wang Y,"Seventy-four surface sediment samples were collected from the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea to determine the content of metal(loid)s (As, Cu, Cd, Ni, Pb, Zn and Cr). Metal(loid)s content in these sediments varied from 2.36-41.90 mg/kg for As, 8.63-82.28 mg/kg for Cu, 0.14-0.71 mg/kg for Cd, 11.86-100.60 mg/kg for Ni, 8.30-27.58 mg/kg for Pb, 39.93-391.43 mg/kg for Zn, and 40.96-106.49 mg/kg for Cr. The pH and water-soluble organic carbon content had considerable impacts on the content of metal(loid)s in sediment, but the texture of sediment has limited influence on metal(loid)s content in sediment. In addition, the hotspots of most of these metal(loid)s appeared in the Beaufort Sea region. The geoaccumulation index (I(geo)) indicated that Cd was the metal with the highest contamination in these sediments, with 55.41% of the sample sites posing moderate pollution. The ecological risk for As, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn and Cr indicates low ecological risk (100%), while Cd posed moderate risk (35.14%), considerable risk (54.05%) and high risk (10.81%) and attributed more than 76.45% of the total potential ecological risk of these metal(loid)s.",2022,Jun,Mar Pollut Bull,179,,113729,,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.113729,35537309,#524,Zheng 2022,,marine; primary source; sediment
"Sedimentary processes, metal enrichment and potential ecological risk of metals in lacustrine sediments of Svalbard, Arctic.",Choudhary S; Nayak GN; Khare N,"The Svalbard archipelago is a glacial environment bestowed with various lakes that act as a natural archive for understanding environmental conditions. The accumulation of sediments in lake basins and their distribution are affected by different mechanisms. Therefore, to understand the distribution of sediments, factors controlling the transport and metal enrichment in the lake environment, core sediments were studied from four lakes (L-A, L-1, L-2 and L-3). Also, the potential ecological risk index (PERI) was computed to determine the impact of metal enrichment on the sediment-associated biota. The results obtained showed that the distribution of trace elements was mainly controlled by the major elements like Al, Ti, Fe, and Mn attributed to their lithogenic origin. Index of geoaccumulation (I(geo)) of all four lakes showed a moderate level of enrichment of metals like Cr and Cd indicating an enhanced supply of these metals probably from the catchment rocks and anthropogenic activities. A comparison of metals with Arctic Sediment Quality Guidelines (ASQGs) showed that Cd, Cr and Cu were enriched in the sediments of all the cores indicating the occurrence of adverse biological effects. Furthermore, a potential ecological risk index (PERI) revealed high Cd indicating considerable potential ecological risk to the sediment-associated biota.

"Exposure of a small Arctic seabird, the little auk (Alle alle) breeding in Svalbard, to selected elements throughout the course of a year.",Pacyna-Kuchta AD; Jakubas D; Frankowski M; Polkowska Ż; Wojczulanis-Jakubas K,"The Arctic marine ecosystem can be altered by processes of natural and anthropogenic origin. Spatio-temporal variation in species exposure to contamination is still poorly understood. Here, we studied elemental concentrations in the non-lethally collected samples from the most numerous seabird in European Arctic, the little auk (Alle alle) nesting in one breeding colony in Svalbard. This seabird spent the breeding season in the high-Arctic zone and the non-breeding period in sub-Arctic areas what may implicate spatio-temporal variation in elements bioaccumulation. We determined concentrations of 19 elements in adults feathers to determine levels of exposure during part of the pre-breeding (n = 74) and post-breeding (n = 74) seasons, feathers from nestlings (n = 18) to determine local contamination, and chick down (n = 16) and post-hatching eggshells (n = 18) to determine maternal input to offspring. During the pre-breeding period adults accumulated in their feathers significantly more Hg (one third of feathers exceeded the established toxicity threshold), Se and Mn compared to the post-breeding period. It reflects a higher exposition of birds to contaminants in pre-breeding moult areas outside the High Arctic compared to the post-breeding moult in the High Arctic. Sex differences in adult feathers representing the post-breeding period were found only for Ca and Zn with higher values in females. Chick down was characterized by high levels of several essential elements, an intermediate level of Hg and Se, and the highest Se:Hg molar ratios of all groups. Chick body feathers had the highest level of Cu and K among all the studied groups. Post-hatching eggshells were characterized by high Sr level (exceeding 2000 μg/g).

Fauna communities were classified as good, but moderate disturbance was recorded along an environmental gradient defined by depth and tailings-induced parameters such as particle size and copper.

Trapped material was analysed for suspended particulate matter (SPM), total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (TN), Cu, and Al. Only about 10% of the Cu from the river is trapped in the estuary. Still there was a moderate but significant reduction in Cu concentration in the trap SPM from 1990 to 1994, reflecting the industrial reductions, but only if excluding summer samples apparently influenced by antifouling Cu from boat paint.

Heavy metals in zooplankton and decapod crustaceans from the Barents Sea.,Zauke GP; Schmalenbach I,"Trace metals (Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) were analysed in zooplankton samples and decapod crustaceans collected on cruises of ""RV Walther Herwig III"" to the Barents Sea (Summer 1991, 1994 and 2000). We found a substantial spatial heterogeneity in the decapod crustacean Pandalus borealis, with increasing Cd concentrations from the south (North Cape Bank; 0.7 mg kg(-1) DW) to the north (north of Svalbard; 4.7 mg kg(-1)), supporting the hypothesis that the frequently reported Cd-anomaly in polar crustaceans might be extended to the Barents Sea. Regarding various crustaceans and zooplankton collectives (2000) a distinct interspecific heterogeneity of metals was obvious, with lowest Cd concentrations in euphausiids and chaetognaths and highest ones in decapods and hyperiid amphipods; lowest Cu concentrations in chaetognaths and copepods and highest ones in euphausiids and decapods; and lowest Zn concentrations in euphausiids and decapods and highest ones in some copepods. For Pb many values were below or close to the limit of detection, suggesting that Pb concentrations about 0.4 mg kg(-1) might serve as a regional background value. Results for Cd, Cu and Zn in copepods of this study are largely within the reported range, but high Cd concentrations in copepods from summer in contrast to reported lower ones during winter/spring may be related either to changing accumulation strategies of the copepod species involved or to seasonally changing Cd absorption in copepods from food.",2006,Apr,Sci Total Environ,359,01-Mar,283-94,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2005.09.002,16194562,#576,Zauke 2006,,Cu biology; biota; marine; pre-2010; primary source
Impacts of climate change on metal leaching and partitioning for submarine mine tailings disposal.,Pedersen KB; Lejon T; Jensen PE; Ottosen LM; Frantzen M; Evenset A,"At present, there are no standardised tests to assess metal leaching during submarine tailings discharge. In this study the influence of variables known to affect metal mobility and availability (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pH, salinity, temperature, aerated/anoxic conditions) along with variables affected by the discharge conditions (flocculant concentration, suspension) were studied in bench-scale experiments. The leaching tests were developed based on the case of a copper mine by Repparfjorden, northern Norway, which is planned to re-open in 2022. The experiments, which had three week duration, revealed low (<6 %) leaching of metals. Multivariate analysis showed that all variables, apart from DOC, highly influenced leaching and partitioning of at least one metal (Ba, Cr, Cu, and/or Mn). The high quantity of the planned annual discharge of mine tailings to the fjord (1-2 million tonnes) warranted estimation of the leached quantity of metals. Multivariate models, using present-day conditions in the fjord, estimated leaching of up to 124 kg Ba, 154 kg Cu and 2400 kg Mn per year during discharge of tailings. Future changes in the fjord conditions caused by climate change (decreased pH, increased temperature) was predicted by the multivariate models to increase the leaching up to 55 %, by the year 2065. The bench-scale experiments demonstrated the importance of including relevant variables (such as pH, salinity, and temperature) for metal leaching and -partitioning in leaching tests. The results showed that metal leaching during discharge is expected and will increase in the future due to the changed conditions caused by the foreseen climate change, and thereby underline the importance of monitoring metal concentrations in water during operations to determine the fate of metals in the fjord.",2022,Nov,Mar Pollut Bull,184,,114197,,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.114197,36208554,#588,Pedersen 2022,,Cu environmental chemistry; marine; primary source; projection/estimation; sediment
Trace metals in skeletal calcite of echinoderms from the Barents Sea.,Iglikowska A; Piwoni-Piórewicz A; Cieślik BM; Żyłan D; Waszczuk P; Kukliński P,"This study investigates the skeletal accumulation of selected elements (Al, Ag, As, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Pb, Sr, Zn) in echinoderms inhabiting Barents Sea, an area impacted by human activities from northern Norway and Kola Peninsula, known sources of metal pollution. The primary aim was to have insight whether metals incorporation in the skeleton of Arctic echinoderms is regulated physiologically by the organism or influenced by abiotic environmental conditions (expressed as distance from the source of metal pollution). Metal concentrations were analysed in 17 species from four echinoderm classes: Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea, Crinoidea and Echinoidea. The results revealed species-specific accumulation patterns for most metals, indicating a strong biological control over metal incorporation. In crinoid Heliometra glacialis, a negative correlation between body size and skeletal concentrations of Al, Fe, Mg and Mn was observed. This correlation was ascribed to age-related metabolic traits and a likely mechanism for removing foreign metals from the skeletal calcite. The relationships between environmental factors and metal accumulation patterns were less clear. However, higher concentrations of Al, Fe, Mg, Mn and Pb were found in suspension feeders collected near glaciers, which were potential sources of suspended material. Asteroids exhibited particularly high concentrations of Cu, Fe, Cr, Hg compared to species from the other regions, suggesting that their calcified skeletons may serve as storage mechanisms to prevent toxic effects in other body parts.

The indicator organisms analysed as bulked/individual samples were cod (Gadus morhua, n approximately 1170; n approximately 240 for organochlorines), dab (Limanda limanda, n approximately 75), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa, n approximately 55) lemon sole (Microstomus kitt, n approximately 13). and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis, n approximately 200) collected between 1991-2000. Based on the 90-95 percentiles of measurements at localities far from point sources, we propose for liver of cod a reference level for SigmaPCB(7) (CBs 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180) of 500 microg kg(-1) w.w. and further for DDE 200 microg kg(-1), SigmaHCHs 30 microg kg(-1), HCB 20 and OCS 5 microgkg(-1) w.w. In the same order the proposed reference levels for liver of dab are: 150, 60, 15, 5, and 2 microgkg(-1) w.w.; and for the soft body of mussels: 3, 1, 1, 0.1 and 0.1 microg kg(-1) wet weight. Reference levels of metals are 0.1 mgHg kg(-1) w.w. in fish fillet, and for Hg, Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu in mussels 0.2, 2, 3, 200 and 10 mg kg(-1) d.w., respectively. Hg in fillet of cod and dab were positively correlated with length and weight.

Levels and interactions of heavy metals in sea birds from Svalbard and the Antarctic.,Norheim G,"Samples of liver and kidney from 92 seabirds of ten species collected on Spitsbergen and in the Antarctic, were analysed for their content of copper, zinc, cadmium, lead, mercury and selenium. Significantly higher levels of copper and zinc were observed in birds from Spitsbergen than in those from the Antarctic, while the opposite was true for selenium. The highest cadmium levels were found in fulmar Fulmarus glacialis and macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus. A possibility of kidney damage due to cadmium exists. The highest mercury levels were recorded in brown skua Catharacta lonnbergi collected at Bouvetøya. Lead was not detected in any of the birds. Significant correlations were observed between levels of several of the metals studied, especially between cadminum and zinc and between mercury and selenium. However, for all birds, the highest correlation coefficients were observed when the molar concentrations of cadmium plus mercury, and selenium plus zinc, were used in the calculations. Thus several protective mechanisms may operate to diminish effects of heavy metal contaminants.",1987,,Environ Pollut,47,2,83-94,,10.1016/0269-7491(87)90039-x,15092711,#622,Norheim 1987,,Cu biology; biota; pre-2010; terrestrial
"Toxic and essential elements in seafood from Mausund, Norway.",Ervik H; Finne TE; Jenssen BM,"In annual surveys conducted during the period 2012-2015, concentrations of the toxic or essential elements B, Se, Cd, Sn, Cs, Hg, Pb, Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, and As were analyzed in brown meat of edible crab (Cancer pagurus), and filets of cod (Gadus morhua) and halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) in one of the most important commercial crab fishing areas in Norway, at Mausund in Frøya municipality in Sør-Trøndelag, Norway. Concentrations of the elements were analyzed in sediments in 2015. Several salmon farms are located in this area. Samples were extracted by HNO(3) and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Crab, cod, and halibut were caught in a total of five locations. One of these locations was in the proximity of a salmon farm. In edible crabs, the mean ranks were significantly different between two locations only for Sn (p = 0.034). When all data were pooled, the mean ranks statistics showed significant difference between all years for the elements Se (p = < 0.001), Cs (p = 0.005), Mn (p = 0.002), Zn (p = 0.006), and As (p = 0.001) in edible crab. The study showed elevated levels of Cd in edible crabs in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, with the highest levels in 2015. In cod, there were significant differences between locations for the elements B (p = 0.003), and Pb (p = 0.04), as well as between the years for the elements B, Sn, Cs, Hg, Cr, and As (p = < 0.01). The study showed elevated level of Pb in cod in 2013. Halibut showed no significant differences between years or locations for any elements.

Induction and activity of oxidative stress-related proteins during waterborne Cu-exposure in brown trout (Salmo trutta).,Hansen BH; Rømma S; Søfteland LI; Olsvik PA; Andersen RA,"Induction of gene transcription for proteins and enzymes involved in metal-mediated oxidative stress were studied in brown trout transferred to a Cu-contaminated river in the Røros region in Central Norway. In addition to metallothionein (MT-A), Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) gene transcription, protein levels of MT and enzyme activities of SOD and CAT were analyzed in gill, liver and kidney. MT-A, SOD and GR transcription increased significantly along with uptake of Cu in gills, while only transcription of MT-A was found to respond in liver and kidney during the exposure. Already present MT proteins in gills seemed to be oxidized during the exposure, probably caused by Cu-mediated oxidative stress, and no increase in MT protein levels were observed in gills. SOD and CAT enzyme levels were affected in all tissues during the exposure. A negative correlation between SOD and CAT activities was observed in gills, and we suggest that the activities of these enzymes were influenced not only through transcription. GPx and GR transcription levels correlated positively with each other in gills and liver, indicating their shared function in GSH-turnover. Levels of MT and activity of SOD and CAT dealing with metal-induced oxidative stress appear to be regulated not only through gene transcription, but also through post-translational mechanisms.",2006,Dec,Chemosphere,65,10,1707-14,,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.04.088,16780922,#656,Hansen 2006,,Cu biology; biota; freshwater; pre-2010; primary source
Chemical assessment of marine sediments in vicinity of Norwegian fish farms - A pilot study.,Aslam SN; Venzi MS; Venkatraman V; Mikkelsen Ø,"While aquaculture is growing rapidly all over the world and generating many economic benefits, so have the environmental concerns about the externalities posed by the fish-farming industry. The distribution profiles of organic compounds and inorganic elements were explored in marine surface sediments collected in proximity of two active Norwegian fish farms, Hestøya and Nørholmen (<200-1100 m from the perimeter edge of the installations). Overall, the sediment organic matter (SOM) content was 7.3 ± 4.9%, with 7.9 ± 5.1% and 4.0 ± 0.5% for Hestøya and Nørholmen, respectively. A non-targeted analysis was performed for screening organic compounds in marine sediments, and the presence of 60 compounds was detected. Among suspect compounds were alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, aldehydes, ketones, esters, alcohols, diols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), terpenes and terpenoids. Heptanal, benzaldehyde, 4-oxoisophorone, 1,7-dimethylnaphthalene and 3-bromophenol were the most abundant compounds in marine sediments. In total, concentrations of 47 elements were measured, concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mo, Ni, Sn and Zn were strongly influenced by anthropogenic inputs, while concentrations of Ce, Co, Al, Fe and Ti were related to the geology of the local bedrock. The chemical composition of marine sediments was different at Hestøya and Nørholmen, indicating different anthropogenic inputs in these areas. In general, concentrations of toxic elements were below the proposed guidelines for Norwegian marine sediment quality and can be characterised as background pollution. Overall, fish-farming activities had only a minor or negligible influence on marine sediments and are unlikely to cause any harm to local aquatic life in the studied area.",2020,Aug,Sci Total Environ,732,,139130,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139130,32438149,#658,Aslam 2020,,marine; sediment
Spatial and temporal trends of contaminants in mussel sampled around the Icelandic coastline.,Sturludottir E; Gunnlaugsdottir H; Jorundsdottir HO; Magnusdottir EV; Olafsdottir K; Stefansson G,"Contaminants have been determined in blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) at 11 locations around the Icelandic coastline from 1990 to 2010. The aim of the present study was to investigate if there has been a change in concentration of contaminants around the Icelandic coastline for the last two decades and if the concentrations and changes, if present, were consistent between locations. Concentrations of the persistent organic pollutants, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (p,p'-DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), α-hexachlorocyclohexane (α-HCH), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB-153) and trans-nonachlor, have decreased at most of the sampling locations in Iceland in recent years. However, an increasing trend was found at a few locations that could be explained by anthropogenic activity. The concentration levels of the persistent organics were much lower than found at the Norwegian, USA and Chinese coasts, especially levels of p,p'-DDE. The concentration of copper and selenium had a consistent pattern of change and concentration between locations over the period which showed a decreasing trend in recent years. The trace elements arsenic, cadmium, mercury and zinc showed more variation in concentration between locations, the concentration of arsenic, mercury and zinc was fairly stable over the period, whereas there were fluctuations in cadmium concentrations. The concentrations of cadmium and zinc were observed to be somewhat higher than found in mussels from Norway, USA and China but values of mercury and lead were much lower in the mussel sampled in Iceland. The higher concentrations of cadmium and zinc can be explained by the volcanic activity in Iceland but no major anthropogenic sources of trace elements are known in Iceland.",2013,Jun,Sci Total Environ,454-455,,500-9,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.03.042,23567170,#687,Sturludottir 2013,,biota; marine; primary source
Heavy metal contents in whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) along a pollution gradient in a subarctic watercourse.,Amundsen PA; Kashulin NA; Terentjev P; Gjelland KØ; Koroleva IM; Dauvalter VA; Sandimirov S; Kashulin A; Knudsen R,"Metallurgic industry is a source of serious environmental pollution related to the emission of heavy metals. Freshwater systems are focal points for pollution, acting as sinks for contaminants that may end up in fish and humans. The Pasvik watercourse in the border area between Finland, Norway and Russia is located in the vicinity of the Pechenganickel metallurgic enterprises, and the lower part of the watershed drains the Nikel smelters directly through Lake Kuetsjarvi. Heavy metal (Ni, Cu, Cd, Zn, Pb and Hg) concentrations in environment (water and sediments) and whitefish Coregonus lavaretus tissue (gills, liver, kidney and muscle) were contrasted between five lake localities situated along a spatial gradient of increasing distance (5-100 km) to the smelters. The heavy metal concentrations, in particular Ni, Cu and Cd, were highly elevated in Kuetsjarvi, but steeply declined with increasing distance to the smelters and were moderate or low in the other four localities. The study demonstrates that the majority of metal emissions and runoffs are deposited near the pollution source, and only moderate amounts of the heavy metal contaminants seem to be transported at further distances. Bioaccumulation of Hg occurred in all investigated tissues, and higher Hg concentrations in planktivorous versus benthivorous whitefish furthermore indicated that pelagic foraging is associated with higher levels of Hg biomagnification.

Trends and potential human health risk of trace elements accumulated in transplanted blue mussels during restoration activities of Flekkefjord fjord (Southern Norway).,Parolini M; Panseri S; Håland Gaeta F; Rossi L; Dell'Anno M; Ceriani F; De Felice B; Rafoss T; Arioli F; Pilu S; Chiesa LM,"The monitoring of contaminants represents a priority to preserve the integrity of marine ecosystems, as well as to plan and to manage restoration activities in order to protect environmental and human health. In the present study, a 6-months active biomonitoring was performed to explore the levels of eighteen trace and toxic elements, including heavy metals (TEs; i.e. Al, As, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Sr, Ti, and Zn), accumulated in soft tissues of blue mussel (Mytilus edulis Linnaeus, 1758) individuals transplanted at different depths (5- and 15-m depth) in five locations within the Flekkefjord fjord (Southern Norway). As this area suffered a long-lasting contamination due to both organic and inorganic contaminants, a series of restoration activities were activated to tackle and to prevent potential risks for ecosystem and local population. Our results demonstrated that the levels of TEs accumulated in edible tissues of transplanted mussels in the Flekkefjord fjord were generally low before the beginning of the restoration activities. However, location- and time-specific differences in the accumulation of TEs were noted after the implementation of such activities. Interestingly, the levels of Fe and Mn significantly increased after the beginning of the restoration activities, likely because the release of these TEs from the slag used in such operations and/or resuspension of contaminated sediments. However, assuming that native mussels can accumulate the same TEs at levels measured in transplanted individuals, our results suggest a substantial safety for human consumption of native mussels from the Flekkefjord fjord, regardless of restoration activities.",2022,Feb,Environ Monit Assess,194,3,208,,10.1007/s10661-022-09835-7,35194687,#701,Parolini 2022,,Cu biology; biota; human; marine; primary source
Trace metal mobility in sub-seabed sediments by CO(2) seepage under high-pressure conditions.,Basallote MD; Borrero-Santiago AR; Cánovas CR; Hammer KM; Olsen AJ; Ardelan MV,"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the third contributor to cumulative carbon emission reductions required by the second half of this century. Although this is a promising technology for reducing atmospheric CO(2), it is only affordable if the confinement of the gas is guaranteed for hundreds of years. Hence, it is of paramount importance to figure out and predict the chemical and biological effects associated with potential CO(2) leakage, to provide decision makers with a good basis for choosing technology and potential storage sites. To this end, a titanium reactor (1.4 m(3)) was used to study CO(2) seepage under realistic sub-seabed conditions (30 bar pressure and 7 °C). The injection of CO(2) was calibrated to decrease the pH value from 8.1 to 7.3, which may be the pH found near a leakage point. This pH value also coincides with predictions for near-future ocean pH under current CO(2) emissions worldwide. The results from this study demonstrate that there are some elements, i.e., Fe, Co, Pb, Ce, Zn and Cu, present in deep marine sediments, that are strongly affected by the reduced pH levels related to CO(2) addition. The dissolved concentrations of Fe, Pb and, to a lesser extent, Cr increased, due probably to weakening of the Fe/Mn shuttle by increased dissolved concentrations of CO(2). Desorption processes from oxyhydroxide surfaces due to acidification may explain the release of Co, Ni and Ce observed during the experiment. The increased CO(2) concentration also led to increased metal bioavailability, suggested by higher values for labile metal species. Conversely, Cd mobility seems not to be affected by CO(2)-associated acidification. It is concluded that the determination of those elements most affected by CO(2)-related acidification in a sub-seabed CO(2) storage perimeter (i.e., sediment, sediment-water interface and water column) would be a simple and effective technique to verify suspected leakage.",2020,Jan,Sci Total Environ,700,,134761,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134761,31706093,#706,Basallote 2020,"Sam Welch (2025-07-18 18:48:02)(Select): On closer inspection, inside a tank designed to simulate a marine environment. ; PIERRE  BLEVIN (2025-07-17 04:21:31)(Screen): worth to check the geo area; ",Cu environmental chemistry; background; lab study; marine; primary source
Species and element-specific associations of trace elements with body size in mesopelagic fish and crustaceans from the North-East Atlantic.,Wiech M; García-Seoane E; Zhu Y; Fuglås MCV; Petersen SW; Øyan S; Berntssen MHG; Gautam N; Prabhu Philip AJ; Azad AM,"We explored the association between standard body length and whole-body element concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Se, V, and Zn in four common mesopelagic species collected from fjord and offshore locations of the North-East Atlantic. These included silvery lightfish (Maurolicus muelleri), Glacier lanternfish (Benthosema glaciale), Northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica), and Arctic red prawn (Eusergeses arcticus), and a large size-range was covered for each species. We found that the concentrations of most elements changed with size in the fish species and E. arcticus, and to a lesser degree in M. norvegica, likely due to its large growth variability which might have blurred the accumulation and dilution patterns. For the fjord samples, more elements were significantly associated with body length than for the offshore samples. Essential elements were mostly showing significant decreases in concentration with body size and growth dilution was suggested to be an important factor; however, further research is advised. For M. muelleri, Hg concentrations and δ(15)N increased with size, while for B. glaciale, neither Hg concentrations nor δ(15)N clearly increased with size in offshore locations, suggesting an association between Hg concentrations and trophic position. Regarding food safety, Cd concentrations might be of concern for direct consumption of whole individuals for M. muelleri and B. glaciale caught in offshore locations, as more than half of the individuals, meaning the smallest ones, exceeded the European legal maximum level.

Temporal trends of contaminants in cod from Icelandic waters.,Sturludottir E; Gunnlaugsdottir H; Jorundsdottir HO; Magnusdottir EV; Olafsdottir K; Stefansson G,"Contaminants have been analyzed in cod (Gadus morhua) since 1990 as part of the national monitoring program for the environmental conditions in the sea around Iceland. The aim of this study was to determine the temporal trends of persistent organic pollutants (POPs: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene (p,p'-DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), chlordanes (CHLs) and toxaphenes (Tox)) and trace elements (As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, Se and Zn) in cod over the last two decades at two different locations in the Arctic Ocean north of Iceland. The relationship between the contaminant concentrations and biological covariates was also determined. All of the POPs showed decreasing trends but the trace elements showed no clear signs of trend except arsenic which showed an increasing trend and zinc which showed a decreasing trend. The concentration of the POPs were lower or similar in the Icelandic cod compared to cod sampled in Norway, the Barents Sea and in the Baltic Sea, except for HCB which was higher in the Icelandic cod compared to the Norwegian cod. The concentration of the trace elements As, Cu, Hg and Zn were similar in the Icelandic cod compared to cod sampled in Norway and Greenland but the concentration of Cd was higher in the Icelandic cod. The inclusion of the biological covariates was found to be important for the statistical analysis.

We found a substantial interspecific heterogeneity, e.g. with rather low Cd concentrations in calanoid copepods (0.1-0.7 mg kg-1, dry wt.) but remarkably high levels in the decapod Hymenodora glacialis (7-9 mg kg-1) and in the amphipods Themisto abyssorum and T. libellula (24-34 kg-1). In general, Pb was low (< 1 mg kg-1), while some enhanced Ni concentrations were found in the ostracod Conchoecia borealis (66-86 mg kg-1). A comparison to world-wide reported data on marine crustaceans did not reveal any suggestions on increased metal availabilities in both areas investigated, although one might expect a transport of some metals from Siberian rivers across the pole by the Transpolar Ice Drift Stream.

The investigation aimed at revealing differences in the accumulation pattern of heavy metals in mussels inhabiting sediments characterized by varying metal bioavailability. The contents of metals adsorbed to sediments and associated with iron and manganese hydroxides, which were obtained by sequential extraction, were utilized as a measure of metal bioavailability. The contents of Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu and Cr in mussels collected off Spitsbergen were generally lower than those in mussels from the Baltic Sea. In sediments collected off Spitsbergen the bioavailable fraction represented a small proportion (0-3.7% adsorbed metals and 0-11% associated with metals hydroxides) of total heavy metal contents. In sediments from the Baltic Sea the percentages of metals adsorbed and bound to hydroxides were 1-46% and 1-13%, respectively.

"Spatial and temporal trends of selected trace elements in liver tissue from polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from Alaska, Canada and Greenland.",Routti H; Letcher RJ; Born EW; Branigan M; Dietz R; Evans TJ; Fisk AT; Peacock E; Sonne C,"Spatial trends and comparative changes in time of selected trace elements were studied in liver tissue from polar bears from ten different subpopulation locations in Alaska, Canadian Arctic and East Greenland. For nine of the trace elements (As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Mn, Pb, Rb, Se and Zn) spatial trends were investigated in 136 specimens sampled during 2005-2008 from bears from these ten subpopulations. Concentrations of Hg, Se and As were highest in the (northern and southern) Beaufort Sea area and lowest in (western and southern) Hudson Bay area and Chukchi/Bering Sea. In contrast, concentrations of Cd showed an increasing trend from east to west. Minor or no spatial trends were observed for Cu, Mn, Rb and Zn. Spatial trends were in agreement with previous studies, possibly explained by natural phenomena. To assess temporal changes of Cd, Hg, Se and Zn concentrations during the last decades, we compared our results to previously published data. These time comparisons suggested recent Hg increase in East Greenland polar bears. This may be related to Hg emissions and/or climate-induced changes in Hg cycles or changes in the polar bear food web related to global warming. Also, Hg:Se molar ratio has increased in East Greenland polar bears, which suggests there may be an increased risk for Hg(2+)-mediated toxicity. Since the underlying reasons for spatial trends or changes in time of trace elements in the Arctic are still largely unknown, future studies should focus on the role of changing climate and trace metal emissions on geographical and temporal trends of trace elements.",2011,Aug,J Environ Monit,13,8,2260-7,,10.1039/c1em10088b,21687839,#741,Routti 2011,,Cu biology; biota; marine; primary source; terrestrial
Biogeochemical impact of historical submarine mine tailings on benthic ecosystems in the Repparfjord (Northern Norway).,Hoff M; Argentino C; Huljek L; Fiket Ž; Mun Y; Angeles IB; Palinkas SS; Panieri G,"Historical copper mine tailings deposited in the Repparfjord, Northern Norway, provided new insight into the biogeochemical impact of submarine tailings disposals on high-latitude coastal ecosystems. The submarine tailings disposal in the Repparfjord represents a product of mining activities between 1972 and 1979. Their environmental impact has been extensively studied during the last decade, but geochemistry of the sediment pore water, which is crucial to assess and monitor the in-situ metal leaching and bioavailability, has never been analysed. The actual impact on the benthic fauna remains poorly known. Therefore, this study couples the pore water chemistry and the foraminiferal analysis obtained from selected sediment cores (gravity core, multicore, box cores) to examine metal stability and the past and current status of the foraminifera community. We measured down-core sulfate and trace metal concentrations and Eh-Ph and applied the Shannon index, the AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (F-AMBI) index and the foraminiferal abnormality index. This study confirms the ongoing leaching of Cu from the underlying mine tailings and release across the sediment-water interface. Leaching of Ni, Zn and Pb have been attributed to weathering of natural bedrock lithologies. The original benthic foraminiferal community disappeared almost entirely during the disposal period, and now it is dominated by stress-tolerant and opportunistic species like Bulimina marginata and Spiroplectammina biformis.

Accumulation of atmospheric radionuclides and heavy metals in cryoconite holes on an Arctic glacier.,Łokas E; Zaborska A; Kolicka M; Różycki M; Zawierucha K,"Surface of glaciers is covered by mineral and organic dust, together with microorganisms forming cryoconite granules. Despite fact that glaciers and ice sheets constitute significance part of land surface, reservoir of freshwater, and sites of high biological production, the knowledge on the cryoconite granules still remain unsatisfactory. This study presents information on radionuclide and heavy metal contents in cryoconites. Cryoconites collected from the Hans Glacier in SW Spitsbergen reveal high activity concentrations of anthropogenic ((238,239,240)Pu, (137)Cs, (90)Sr) and natural ((210)Pb) radionuclides. The (238)Pu/(239+240)Pu activity ratios in these cryoconites significantly exceed the mean global fallout ratio (0.025). The (238)Pu/(239+240)Pu ranged from 0.064 to 0.118. The (239+240)Pu/(137)Cs varied from 0.011 ± 0.003 to 0.030 ± 0.007. Such activity ratios as observed in these cryoconites were significantly higher than the values characterizing global fallout, pointing to possible contributions of these radionuclides from other sources. Heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Fe, and Mn) in cryoconites exceed both UCC concentrations and local rocks' concentrations, particularly for cadmium. The concentration ratios of stable lead isotopes ((206)Pb/(207)Pb, (208)Pb/(206)Pb) were determined to discriminate between the natural and anthropogenic sources of Pb in cryoconites and to confirm the strong anthropogenic contribution to heavy metal deposition in the Arctic. In investigated cryoconite holes, two groups of invertebrates, both extremophiles, Tardigrada and Rotifera were detected. Our study indicate that cryoconites are aggregates of mineral and organic substances on surfaces of glaciers are able to accumulate large amounts of airborne pollutants bound to extracellular polymeric substances secreted by microorganisms.",2016,Oct,Chemosphere,160,,162-72,,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.06.051,27372266,#750,Łokas 2016,,Cu environmental chemistry; biota; terrestrial
Toxic and essential elements changed in black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) during their stay in an Arctic breeding area.,Overjordet IB; Kongsrud MB; Gabrielsen GW; Berg T; Ruus A; Evenset A; Borgå K; Christensen G; Jenssen BM,"Seasonal fluctuations in mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and selenium (Se) concentrations were studied in black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) from Kongsfjorden, Svalbard (79°57'N, 12°12'E). Element concentrations were determined in muscle and liver tissue in kittiwakes collected in May, July and October 2007. Stable isotopes of carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) were analysed in muscle tissue to calculate trophic position (TP) and examine the possible influence of carbon source on element accumulation. Metallothionein (MT) concentrations in liver, as well as Hg and Cd concentration in size-fractionated liver supernatant were determined to evaluate the association between elements and MT. Mercury concentrations declined from May through July to October in both tissues, while concentrations of Cd were similar in May and July and lower in October. A decline in TP between May and July, indicating a shift from fish-based diet towards an invertebrate-based diet explains the declining Hg concentration. The low Hg and Cd concentrations in October may be a result of an increased elimination, probably related to moulting. Selenium decreased in the same manner as Hg in liver and muscle, possibly related to the formation of Se-Hg complexes. Zinc and Cu did not fluctuate in muscle tissue, whereas hepatic Zn concentrations where highest in May. Hepatic Zn concentrations were higher in females compared to males in May, possibly related to egg production. Hepatic MT concentrations were lower in October compared to July, following the same trend as Hg and Cd. Cadmium was predominantly bound to the MT fraction of proteins in liver tissue, whereas Hg was associated with the larger proteins, indicating that MT was not sequestering Hg in the kittiwakes.",2015,Jan,Sci Total Environ,502,,548-56,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.09.058,25300019,#756,Overjordet 2015,,Cu biology; biota; marine; primary source; terrestrial
Induction and activity of oxidative stress-related proteins during waterborne Cd/Zn-exposure in brown trout (Salmo trutta).,Hansen BH; Rømma S; Garmo ØA; Pedersen SA; Olsvik PA; Andersen RA,"We studied how transcript levels of metallothionein (MT), Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase (GR) as well as functional protein levels of MT, SOD and CAT in brown trout tissues changed during a 15-days waterborne exposure to Cd and Zn. Trout from a river with low levels of metals (the Stribekken River) was transferred to a river with high levels of Cd and Zn (the Naustebekken River) and exposed up to 15 days. The aim of this transfer experiment was to investigate how exposure to Cd and Zn induced transcription and activities of central antioxidant enzymes and proteins in an environmental setting. Significant uptake of both Cd and Zn was observed in gills during the 15 days exposure, and Cd levels was found to correlate significantly with transcript levels of MT-A, SOD, GPx and GR. Gill concentrations of Zn did not correlate significantly with the transcript levels of the stress genes studied, but Zn might have triggered transcription of proteins which dealt with subsequent accumulation of Cd. SOD and CAT activities increased in gills after transfer, but MT protein levels decreased. In liver, SOD activity and MT protein levels increased, while in kidney only MT protein concentrations were elevated after transfer. There was a general lack of consistency between mRNA transcription and enzyme activities, indicating that these proteins and enzymes are not solely under transcriptional control.",2007,May,Chemosphere,67,11,2241-9,,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2006.12.048,17276485,#765,Hansen 2007,,Cu biology; biota; freshwater; pre-2010; terrestrial
Temperature-driven variation in the removal of heavy metals from contaminated tailings leaching in northern Norway.,Fu S; Lu J,"High amounts of tailings with a low recycling rate are generated during mining and smelting processes, and a lot of environmental problems were caused by heavy metal leaching from tailings. Temperature is a key point in heavy metals leaching, and knowing the effects of temperature on tailings leaching is useful for tailings management. A small-scale batch leaching experiment was conducted at different temperatures to test temperature-driven heavy metal leaching from tailings in the arctic area. The variation in the leaching of heavy metals from tailings was investigated by a small-scale batch leaching experiment. Results showed that 10 °C is a threshold temperature for the leaching activity of the tested elements. Fe, Cr, and Cu are significantly correlated with temperature in the leaching. Leaching rates of Cr, Cu, and Ni increase as temperature rises. Leaching rates of Cr, Cu, Ni, V, and Zn change by a polynomial model with temperatures, whereas that of Fe changes with a linear model. V shows an antagonistic relationship with Cu, Fe, and Ni in the leaching. However, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Fe show a synergistic relationship. Discovering the threshold temperature of leaching tailings in the arctic area and concluding the influence factors and the relationship between heavy metals leaching and temperature are useful for tailings management.",2019,Jan,Environ Monit Assess,191,2,123,,10.1007/s10661-019-7244-3,30706147,#770,Fu 2019,,Cu environmental chemistry; lab study; projection/estimation; sediment; terrestrial
"Effects of biotransport and hydro-meteorological conditions on transport of trace elements in the Scott River (Bellsund, Spitsbergen).",Lehmann-Konera S; Kociuba W; Chmiel S; Franczak Ł; Polkowska Ż,"The shaping of surface water chemistry in the Svalbard Archipelago is strongly dependent on the geology of the catchment and the process of long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants (LRATP). It was found that the dissolved trace elements in the Scott River, which catchment is characterized by a decreasing degree of glaciation, were of the natural origin (i.a. weathering and dissolution of local geological substratum). The exception was Zn originated from LRATP. The paper describe the influence changes in hydro-meteorological conditions and the presence of a seabird colony on the variability in the transport of trace elements within the Scott River catchment. The work assesses long-time fluctuations in the concentration of twenty five trace elements (i.a. Al, Cr, Cu, Pb, Sr, and Zn) from eighty-four surface water samples and their relation to changes in water discharge (Q), precipitation (P), pH, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at two river sites (with one being under the influence of the biotransport factor). Based on the results of matrix correlation and cluster analysis it was found that the additional load of DOC from the nesting site of Larus Argentatus in the mouth section of the river drastically changed the hydro-geochemical cycle of Co, Ni, Zn, Ga, Sr, Rb, Ba and U (0.30 < r < 0.51). Furthermore, the results of cluster analysis confirmed that the bird colony's nesting site was strongly responsible for the presence of U, Rb, Zn, Ni and marine-derived nutrients (e.g. Se and Li). The discharge of glacier meltwater and the alkaline character of water have a negative effect on the dissolution of Li and Mn (-0.31 < r < -0.51), but positively affect the level of Rb and U (r = 0.31 and 0.35, respectively) due to it being washing out a seabird nesting colony in the mouth section of the Scott River. It was observed that the event of rises in air temperature and rain, which results in increased water discharge, caused an intense transport of the trace elements load. Moreover, results of the precipitation sensitivity coefficient factor (CF) proved that precipitation effect the occurrence of Li, Sr and U in the Scott River.",2021,,PeerJ,9,,e11477,,10.7717/peerj.11477,34249484,#787,Lehmann-Konera 2021,,Cu environmental chemistry; air; freshwater; primary source
"Effects of field contamination by metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn) on biometry and mechanics of echinoderm ossicles.",Moureaux C; Simon J; Mannaerts G; Catarino AI; Pernet P; Dubois P,"Echinoderms are known to readily incorporate metals in their calcified endoskeleton. It is currently unclear if this has an impact on the skeleton function or if this can be considered as a detoxification mechanism. In the present work, populations of the sea urchin Echinus acutus and the starfish Asterias rubens were studied in stations distributed along a metal contamination gradient in a Norwegian fjord (Sørfjord). Ossicles involved in major mechanical functions - sea urchin spine and starfish ambulacral plate - were analyzed for their metal concentration (Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) and their biometric and mechanical properties. Starfish plates were more contaminated by Cd, Pb and Zn than sea urchin spines. Cu concentrations were at background levels. In E. acutus, metals principally affected size. In A. rubens, material stiffness and toughness were decreased in the most contaminated station. This reduction is attributed either to the direct incorporation of metals in the calcite lattice and/or to deleterious effects of metals during skeleton ontogenesis. The contrasting incorporation of metals in the skeleton of the two investigated species accounts for the different impact of the metals, including in terms of fitness. The present results clearly indicate that, at least in A. rubens, incorporation of metals in the skeleton cannot be considered as a detoxification mechanism.",2011,Oct,Aquat Toxicol,105,03-Apr,698-707,,10.1016/j.aquatox.2011.09.007,21996256,#795,Moureaux 2011,,Cu biology; marine; primary source; sediment
Trace element levels in harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) and hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) from the Greenland Sea. A multivariate approach.,Julshamn K; Grahl-Nielsen O,"Concentrations of the essential trace elements, iron, copper, zinc and selenium and the non-essential elements arsenic, cadmium, total mercury and lead, were measured in the meat, liver and kidney of two species of seals, harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) and hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) collected in the Greenland Sea. The spread among the individual seals was considerable. However, multivariate statistics simplified the evaluation of the data. The muscle tissue contained lower levels of the elements than kidney and liver. The kidney and liver tissue were also different, in particular with higher levels of iron in the liver and higher levels of cadmium in the kidney. Species differences were clear in both liver and kidney tissue, with higher levels of most of the elements in the hooded seals, while the harp seals had a higher burden of arsenic in the two tissues. Male hooded seals had higher levels of mercury and selenium than the females in all tissues. For harp seal there was a slight difference between the sexes in the muscle tissue, while no difference was observed in the liver and kidney tissues. The juvenile seals generally had lower levels of the elements in their tissues than the adults, although copper and zinc were higher in the muscles and livers of the juveniles as was iron in the muscles. No correlation between age and trace element levels in the tissues of the adult seals was observed.",2000,Apr,Sci Total Environ,250,01-Mar,123-33,,10.1016/s0048-9697(00)00371-5,10811256,#800,Julshamn 2000,,Cu biology; biota; marine; pre-2010
Metallothioneins and trace metals in the dogwhelk Nucella lapillus (L.) collected from Icelandic coasts.,Leung KM; Dewhurst RE; Halldórsson H; Svavarsson J,"Different sizes of the dogwhelk Nucella lapillus were collected from eight locations along the southwest and north coasts of Iceland. Concentrations of total metallothioneins (MTs) and heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Cr, Mn, Ni, and Zn) were analysed using the silver saturation method and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. The level of tributyltin (TBT) contamination was also assessed using imposex indices, the vas deferens stage index (VDSI) and relative penis size index (RPSI). Gufunes N. lapillus presented the highest values of VDSI (4.0) and RPSI (11.1), followed by Grenivík individuals (VDSI = 3.0; RPSI = 0.9), while the Strandakirkja population showed the lowest VDSI (0.3) and zero RPSI. At a standardised size (0.25 g dry soft-body weight), Grenivík N. lapillus exhibited significantly higher concentrations of all metals whereas overall metal concentrations were significantly lower in individuals from Strandakirkja and Garethskagi compared to other study sites. Partial correlation analyses with size correction indicated that MT concentrations were better correlated with Cd and Cu concentrations than with other metals. At the standard size, the pattern of MT concentrations in N. lapillus from different sites was, however, very different from those of metal profiles. Such discrepancies between the patterns of MT and metals in N. lapillus might be explained by the fact that MT induction could be influenced by various factors such as temperature, dietary metal intake, growth rate and co-existence of other MT-inducing chemicals.",2005,,Mar Pollut Bull,51,08-Dec,729-37,,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2005.04.013,15913665,#802,Leung 2005,,Cu biology; biota; pre-2010; primary source
Antioxidative stress proteins and their gene expression in brown trout (Salmo trutta) from three rivers with different heavy metal levels.,Hansen BH; Rømma S; Garmo ØA; Olsvik PA; Andersen RA,"Three populations of brown trout (Salmo trutta) exposed to different metal levels in their natural environments, were studied with respect to antioxidants metallothionein (MT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) as well as for corresponding mRNA levels. In addition, mRNA levels were studied for glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR). The Cd/Zn-exposed trout (Naustebekken River) had higher accumulated levels of Cd, Cu and Zn in gills, and higher levels of MT (both protein and mRNA) in liver and kidney as well as in gills compared to the Cu-exposed trout (Rugla River) and trout from an uncontaminated reference river (Stribekken River). Less MT found in the Cu-exposed trout may increase susceptibility to oxidative stress, but no higher levels of antioxidant mRNAs were found in gills of these trouts. The data indicated that chronic exposures of brown trout to Cd, Zn and/or Cu did not involve maintenance of high activities of SOD and CAT enzymes in gills, although SOD mRNA levels were higher in the Cd/Zn-exposed trout. In livers, mRNA levels of SOD, CAT and GPx were higher in the metal-exposed trout, but in the case of GR this was only seen in kidneys of Cd/Zn-exposed trout. However, both metal-exposed groups had higher activities of SOD enzyme in liver compared to the unexposed reference trout, and CAT activity was found to be higher in kidneys of Cu-exposed trout. The Cu-exposed trout did not seem to rely on MT production to avoid Cu toxicity in gills, but rather by keeping the Cu uptake at a low level. A coordinated expression of different stress genes may also be important in chronic metal exposure. It may be concluded that the observed metal effects relies on acclimation rather than on genetic adaptation in the metal exposed populations.",2006,Jul,Comp Biochem Physiol C Toxicol Pharmacol,143,3,263-74,,10.1016/j.cbpc.2006.02.010,16616685,#809,Hansen 2006,,Cu biology; biota; marine; pre-2010; terrestrial
Atmospheric supply of trace elements studied by peat samples from ombrotrophic bogs.,Steinnes E; Hvatum OØ; Bølviken B; Varskog P,"Concentrations of Fe and 12 trace elements in peat from ombrotrophic bogs were used to estimate the atmospheric deposition of these elements on a temporal and spatial scale. Peat samples were collected at 21 different sites in Norway encompassing large geographical differences in marine influence and air pollution. The study demonstrates that surface peat is an excellent medium to study geographical differences in heavy metal deposition, provided that effects of the surface plant cover are properly considered. Long-range atmospheric transport of pollutants is the main source for As, Cd, Pb, Sb, and Zn, and to a lesser extent for Cu and Se. Biogenic emissions from the ocean appear to be the main source of Se to the peat. The metals Co, Cr, Fe, and Ni are mainly associated with wind-blown local soil dust. Surface enrichment of Mn, and in part Zn, is mainly caused by nutrient circulation between the surface peat and vascular plants growing on it. Deposition of marine salts appears to be the main reason for lower Mn concentrations in the peat near the coast.",2005,Jan-Feb,J Environ Qual,34,1,192-7,,10.2134/jeq2005.0192,15647549,#810,Steinnes 2005,PIERRE  BLEVIN (2025-07-16 05:21:47)(Screen): Might be seen as a source in the marine env?; ,air; freshwater; pre-2010; primary source; terrestrial
"Levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, mercury, cadmium, copper, selenium, arsenic, and zinc in the harbour seal, Phoca vitulina, in Norwegian waters.",Skaare JU; Markussen NH; Norheim G; Haugen S; Holt G,"Residue levels of the chlorinated hydrocarbons polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), total DDT, alpha-, beta- and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and oxychlordane in blubber, and the elements mercury, cadmium, copper, selenium, arsenic, and zinc in liver, of 82 harbour seals, Phoca vitulina, were determined. The seals were found dead or dying in Norwegian waters during the disease outbreak caused by a morbilli virus in 1988. Of the chlorinated hydrocarbons, the highest concentrations were found of PCBs, which were 2-4 times higher than the total DDT concentrations. P,p'-DDE was the main contributor to the total DDT, and constituted about 80%. The PCB and total DDT concentrations ranged from 0.4-38 and 0.1-8.8 mg kg(-1), respectively. The mercury concentrations ranged from 0.1-89 mg kg(-1). Significantly higher mean levels of PCBs (13 mg kg(-1) and mercury (16 mg kg(-1)) were found in blubber and liver, respectively, of seals from the Southern coast of Norway, as compared to the corresponding mean levels in seals from the Oslofjord (8.8 and 4.1 mg kg(-1)), and at the Northwestern coast (5.8 and 7.9 mg kg(-1)), respectively. A significant positive correlation was found between the concentrations of selenium and mercury. When the seals were grouped according to sex and age, females of ageclass > 1 and pups of both sexes had significantly lower PCB and total DDT levels than males ageclass > 1. Significantly higher hepatic mercury levels were found in seals ageclass > 1 as compared to pups. Only low levels of the other organochlorines, cadmium and arsenic, were found.

"A reconstruction of radioactive and chemical pollution of the Grønfjorden (bay), West Spitsbergen Island (Svalbard archipelago).",Namyatov AA; Usyagina IS; Meshcheriakov NI; Ivanova NS; Boyko VV,"Geochronological reconstruction of environmental parameters is an effective method for studying processes related to climatic and anthropogenic factors. To this end, sediment cores were collected in August 2022 from Grønfjorden in the Svalbard archipelago. The bottom sediment layers were dated using the excess (210)Pb method, covering a period of up to 150 years. The concentrations of heavy metals (11 elements) and the activity concentrations of (137)Cs were measured for each layer. Additionally, the change in the distribution coefficient (K(d)s) of cesium between water and bottom sediments was examined in relation to the granulometric composition of the sediment. The study found a direct proportional relationship between the K(d)s value and the content of the pelite fraction (< 0.01 mm) and an inverse relationship with the aleurite content (0.01-0.05 mm). The highest levels of (137)Cs in water, as reconstructed using time-varying K(d)s, were 11 ± 4 Bq m(-3) between 1985 and 1995. The IAEA's recommended K(d)s values were utilized to calculate the concentrations of heavy metals in the water. For the first group of elements, which includes As, Pb, Fe, Zn, Co, and V, the concentrations in the water varied by ± 10%.

Influence of carbon and lipid sources on variation of mercury and other trace elements in polar bears (Ursus maritimus).,Routti H; Letcher RJ; Born EW; Branigan M; Dietz R; Evans TJ; McKinney MA; Peacock E; Sonne C,"In the present study, the authors investigated the influence of carbon and lipid sources on regional differences in liver trace element (As, Cd, Cu, total Hg, Mn, Pb, Rb, Se, and Zn) concentrations measured in polar bears (Ursus maritimus) (n = 121) from 10 Alaskan, Canadian Arctic, and East Greenland subpopulations. Carbon and lipid sources were assessed using δ(13) C in muscle tissue and fatty acid (FA) profiles in subcutaneous adipose tissue as chemical tracers. A negative relationship between total Hg and δ(13) C suggested that polar bears feeding in areas with higher riverine inputs of terrestrial carbon accumulate more Hg than bears feeding in areas with lower freshwater input. Mercury concentrations were also positively related to the FA 20:1n-9, which is biosynthesized in large amounts in Calanus copepods. This result raises the hypothesis that Calanus glacialis are an important link in the uptake of Hg in the marine food web and ultimately in polar bears. Unadjusted total Hg, Se, and As concentrations showed greater geographical variation among polar bear subpopulations compared with concentrations adjusted for carbon and lipid sources. The Hg concentrations adjusted for carbon and lipid sources in Bering-Chukchi Sea polar bear liver tissue remained the lowest among subpopulations. Based on these findings, the authors suggest that carbon and lipid sources for polar bears should be taken into account when one is assessing spatial and temporal trends of long-range transported trace elements.",2012,Dec,Environ Toxicol Chem,31,12,2739-47,,10.1002/etc.2005,22987581,#842,Routti 2012,"Sam Welch (2025-07-21 18:16:05)(Select): Same data as Routti et al., 2011?; ",Cu biology; biota; marine; primary source; terrestrial

To obtain information on the element species distribution, an interphased size and charge fractionation system was applied, where membrane filtration (0.45microm) and ultrafiltration using hollow fibre (nominal cut off 10kDa) were performed prior to charge fractionation using chromatography (cationic and anionic exchange resins). The results show that Pb mainly was present as particulate and colloidal high molecular mass (HMM) species, Cu as colloidal (HMM) and low molecular mass (LMM) species, while Sb and Zn were mainly present as LMM species. The total element concentrations of Pb, Cu, Zn and Sb were positively correlated to water flow and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), suggesting these are important factors in controlling the run-off of the investigated elements in this catchment. During episodes of higher water flow, the increase in element concentration was mainly in the colloidal fraction. Partial redundancy analysis (pRDA) revealed that variations in pH, HMM organic carbon (HMM OC) and LMM organic carbon (LMM OC) explained 47% of the variation in size distribution of the elements, while variations in precipitation and water flow explained 48% of the variation in the charge distribution of the elements.

Potential effects of metals in reacidified limed water bodies in Norway and Sweden.,Lydersen E; Löfgren S,"The goal of this work was to assess risk of chemical and biological effects of metals in reacidified, limed water bodies in Norway and Sweden. The risk assessment is based on a literature review and evaluations of water chemical data from the 1995 Nordic Lake Survey. Compared to the pre-liming period, it us unlikely that enhanced remobilization of inorganic aluminium (Al) or other toxic metals (metal bomb hypothesis) from the catchment, the lake sediment and/or the streambed will occur when limed waters reacidify. Rather, the concentrations in surface waters are expected to be lower than before liming started, because of reduced atmospheric inputs of both strong acids and metals as Cd, Hg, Pb, and Zn during the last 10-20 yr. The concentrations in lakes relative to the biological effect levels, as well as the chemical properties of the different metals suggest that the potential biological risks associated to reacidification of limed lakes decrease in the order Al >> Cd > Pb. The risks associated with Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn are very low and do not have to be considered except in waters with known concentrations larger than the lowest biological risk level. Such waters are very rare (<2%).

Between 14 and 25 sites were sampled in each of the eight catchments ranging in size from 12 to 35 km2. Results show that close to the smelters in Monchegorsk and Nikel, topsoil is clearly enriched in Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Te and V. Cu and Ni median contents in topsoils collected close to Monchegorsk are about 600 times higher than in the Finnish catchments. The effect of open-cast mining and waste dumps of alkaline rocks from the nephelinite industry near Kirovsk can be seen in the elevated contents of Al, Ba, K, La, Mn, Na, Sr, Ti, Y and Zn in topsoil collected in a nearby catchment. For many elements, however, variations observed in single catchments are as great as the total regional variation. Several elements (e.g. Cd, Hg, Cu, Ni, Pb, S, Zn) show strong positive correlation between the organic content of the sample and the element content observed. Thus it is necessary to determine the organic content of the samples and correct the element levels when using depth-related soil samples (here, the 0-5 cm topsoil layer) for regional mapping.",1997,,Environ Pollut,95,1,45-56,,10.1016/s0269-7491(96)00102-9,15093473,#861,Reimann 1997,Sam Welch (2025-07-18 21:29:37)(Select): Only 1 site in geo scope; ,pre-2010; terrestrial
Three decades of atmospheric metal deposition in Norway as evident from analysis of moss samples.,Steinnes E; Berg T; Uggerud HT,"Monitoring of atmospheric deposition of metals in Norway on a nationwide scale using samples of terrestrial moss started in 1977 and has been repeated every 5 years. This has facilitated a detailed record of temporal and spatial trends of metal deposition all over the country as a supplement to measurements based on bulk deposition sampling on a small number of sites. Pb, Zn, Cd, As, Sb, V, Sn, Mo, and Bi all show highest deposition in the far south due to trans-boundary pollution from other parts of Europe, but the contribution from long-range atmospheric transport to metal deposition has decreased substantially over the years. The distributions of Fe, Ni, Cu, Cr, and Co are more affected by local sources, but a decreasing time trend is also evident for these elements. Se is mainly derived from processes in the marine environment. Deposition of metals from Cu-Ni smelters in Russia situated close to the Norwegian border has shown a steadily increasing trend over the time period concerned.",2011,Dec,Sci Total Environ,412-413,,351-8,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.09.086,22078366,#866,Steinnes 2011,,Cu biology; air; biota; terrestrial
Heavy metal contamination in freshwater fish from the border region between Norway and Russia.,Amundsen PA; Staldvik FJ; Lukin AA; Kashulin NA; Popova OA; Reshetnikov YS,"The contents of Cd, Cu, Cr, Hg, Ni and Zn in muscle, liver and gills were studied in whitefish, perch, pike, brown trout, burbot and vendace from three lake localities in a watercourse in the border region between Norway and Russia, in the vicinity of mining activity and several metallurgic smelters. The contents of Cd and Ni in fish tissue increased with increasing proximity to the smelters, whereas the other elements showed similar concentrations at the three localities. The recorded heavy metal concentrations appeared to be within the ranges reported for fish from other metal-contaminated lakes, and higher than comparable observations from unpolluted systems. The heavy metal concentrations were usually lowest in muscle and highest in the liver or the gills. Significant differences in metal concentration levels were found between different fish species, but Hg was the only metal where these species differences were possibly related to biomagnification. For the other elements, the concentrations generally appeared to be inversely related to the trophic level of the fish species.",1997,Aug,Sci Total Environ,201,3,211-24,,10.1016/s0048-9697(97)84058-2,9241871,#871,Amundsen 1997,"Sam Welch (2025-07-15 16:37:10)(Select): For lakes it's questionable whether they'd feed into the marine ecosystem, but I've been including them anyway because I didn't specifically rule them out in the protocol.; PIERRE  BLEVIN (2025-07-09 21:41:15)(Screen): maybe because freshwater ecosystem; ",biota; freshwater; pre-2010; primary source
Heavy metals in fish from the Barents Sea (summer 1994).,Zauke GP; Savinov VM; Ritterhoff J; Savinova T,"To assess the significance of metals in biota of the Barents Sea, preliminary information is presented for the concentrations of Cd, Pb, Hg, Ni, Cu and Zn in liver and muscle tissues of 15 marine fish species collected in the summer of 1994. Lead and Ni concentrations are below limits of detection (< 0.3 and 1.0 mg kg-1 dry wt.) in all tissues, as is Cd in muscle (< 0.10 mg kg-1). Generally, most of our results are within the reported literature range for various Arctic marine systems, especially regarding some commercially important species like cod and redfish, indicating that metal levels are not elevated. However, the interspecific variability is substantial and some remarkably high Cd levels (2.4 and 8.1 mg kg-1 dry wt.) in livers of Anarhichas species (catfish) and Raja fyllae (round skate) point to the problem of a general 'cadmium-anomaly' in polar marine waters, previously inferred from reported results for various pelagic and benthic invertebrates.",1999,Mar,Sci Total Environ,227,02-Mar,161-73,,10.1016/s0048-9697(99)00014-5,10231981,#873,Zauke 1999,,Cu biology; biota; marine; pre-2010; primary source
"Metal accumulation and metallothionein in two populations of brown trout, Salmo trutta, exposed to different natural water environments during a run-off episode.",Olsvik PA; Gundersen P; Andersen RA; Zachariassen KE,"Cd, Cu and Zn concentrations were measured in ambient water as well as in gills, liver and kidney tissues of two natural populations of brown trout (Salmo trutta) during a run-off episode in two rivers with different metal compositions due to mining pollution. Metallothionein (MT) was also measured in these tissues. The two rivers, Rugla (Cu contaminated) and Naustebekken (Cd and Zn contaminated), are located in two neighboring drainage basins separated by the topographic divide near the city of Røros in the County of Sør-Trøndelag, Norway. In Rugla, the Cu concentration increased from 15 µg/l at the low water level to 41 µg/l during the run-off episode. In Naustebekken, corresponding values for Cd were 90-170 ng/l and those for Zn were 49-91 µg/l. Gill concentrations of Cu and Cd/Zn MT in both populations of native trout clearly reflect the presence of these metals in the rivers during the run-off, in accordance with the hypothesis of protection caused by MT induction. When Rugla trout were transferred to Naustebekken and vice versa, both the amounts of MT itself and the Cu contents reflected the concentration of this metal in the new environment, indicating that MT induction also protects against acutely increased metal levels. The measured levels of MT in both native and transferred trout can account for all the Cd present in the tissues, but not for all of the Cu and Zn. The capacity of MT to regulate Cd and Cu in the trout populations in their natural habitat therefore seems clearly present. Our data also indicate that the MT I and II isoforms may bind metals selectively.",2000,Oct,Aquat Toxicol,50,4,301-316,,10.1016/s0166-445x(00)00094-1,10967393,#882,Olsvik 2000,PIERRE  BLEVIN (2025-07-17 04:20:10)(Screen): Might be seen as a source for marine ecocystem?; ,Cu biology; biota; freshwater; pre-2010
"Heavy metal surveys in Nordic lakes; concentrations, geographic patterns and relation to critical limits.",Skjelkvåle BL; Andersen T; Fjeld E; Mannlo J; Wilander A; Johansson K; Jensen JP; Molseenko T,"In the autumn of 1995, coordinated national lake surveys were conducted in the Nordic countries, including Russian Kola. The 11 metals (Pb, Cd, As, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cr, V) investigated in nearly 3000 lakes have generally low concentrations and distinct geographical patterns. Direct and indirect influence of long-range transported air pollution is the major important factor for distribution of Pb, Cd, Zn and to a certain degree Co. Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations in lakes are important for Fe and Mn but also to a certain degree for As, Cr and V. Bedrock geology is the major controlling factor for Cu and Ni, with the exception of areas around the smelters in the Kola peninsula, where the Cu and Ni concentrations in lakes are very high due to local airborne pollution. Bedrock and surficial geology is also an important factor for controlling the concentrations of As, Co, Cr and V. The results indicate that heavy metal pollution in lakes is a minor ecological problem on a regional scale in the Nordic countries.",2001,Feb,Ambio,30,1,02-Oct,,10.1579/0044-7447-30.1.2,11351788,#890,Skjelkvåle 2001,Sam Welch (2025-07-18 21:35:52)(Select): Very low data resolution; PIERRE  BLEVIN (2025-07-17 04:16:14)(Screen): Source to marine ecosystem?; ,freshwater; pre-2010; terrestrial
Trace element contamination of Norwegian Lake sediments.,Rognerud S; Fjeld E,"Concentrations of Sb, Hg, Bi, Cd, Mo, As, Co, Ni, Cr, Cu, V, Pb and Zn in surface and preindustrial sediments from 210 lakes in Norway were used for studying modern atmospheric depositions of these elements. Surface sediments had considerably higher concentrations of Sb, Hg, Bi, Cd, As, Pb than preindustrial sediments. The differences decreased with latitude and altitude. A multivariate analysis including the trace elements and the major constituents (organic matter, Si, Al, Fe and Mn) of surface sediments suggested the following relationships: Sb, Hg, Bi, As, and Pb formed a group with strong associations to organic matter. Ni, Cr and Cu formed a second group, weakly associated to the inorganic sediment fraction (Si and Al). Zn and Cd formed a third group with weak associations to organic matter. Co was associated to Mn, whereas Mo and V showed no important covariations with any other trace elements or major components.",2001,Feb,Ambio,30,1,11-Sep,,10.1579/0044-7447-30.1.11,11351787,#901,Rognerud 2001,"Sam Welch (2025-07-18 21:31:32)(Select): Unless this paper has a great SI section, I don't think we're getting any useful data out of it.; PIERRE  BLEVIN (2025-07-14 20:04:27)(Screen): freshwater but can be seen as a source?; ",freshwater; pre-2010; primary source; terrestrial
