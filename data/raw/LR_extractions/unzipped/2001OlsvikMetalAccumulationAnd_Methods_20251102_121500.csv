S01_Electrofishing_RuglaNaust,Metal accumulation and metallothionein study in brown trout from Rugla and Naustebekken rivers,Sampling Protocol,Electrofishing,Brown trout were captured at low water levels in June-July 1997 and early September 1998 with electric fishing and by basket traps.
S02_PointSampling_RuglaNaust,Metal accumulation and metallothionein study in brown trout from Rugla and Naustebekken rivers,Sampling Protocol,Point sampling,"Water samples for determination of total metal concentrations taken at regular intervals, 17 times in Rugla and 14 times in Naustebekken during ice-free season May-October 1997. Previously acid-washed polyethylene bottles refilled with river water 3 times before sample collection."
F01_DissolvedFrac_RuglaNaust,Metal accumulation and metallothionein study in brown trout from Rugla and Naustebekken rivers,Fractionation Protocol,Dissolved fraction,"Dissolved fractions of Cd, Cu and Zn analyzed in situ by dialysis tubing with cut-off of 2.5-5.0 nm, 13 times in Rugla and 9 times in Naustebekken."
E01_AcidDigest_RuglaNaust,Metal accumulation and metallothionein study in brown trout from Rugla and Naustebekken rivers,Extraction Protocol,Acid digestion,"Tissue samples digested in 65% HNO3, boiled and finally diluted in 0.1 M HNO3 before metal analysis. Water samples: concentrated HNO3 (suprapur, Merck, 65%) added to final concentration of 0.1 M."
A01_AAS_RuglaNaust,Metal accumulation and metallothionein study in brown trout from Rugla and Naustebekken rivers,Analytical Protocol,Atomic absorption spectroscopy,"Metals analyzed by graphite furnace (Cd, Cu) atomic absorption (Perkin-Elmer 5100 AAS). Also Perkin-Elmer 2100 AAS equipped with graphite furnace Model HGA-700 and autosampler Model AS-70."
