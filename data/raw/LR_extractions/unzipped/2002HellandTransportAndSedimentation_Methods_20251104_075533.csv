"S01_PointSampling_GlommaCu19","Transport and sedimentation of Cu in Glomma estuary","Sampling Protocol","Point sampling","Sediment traps consisted of two Perspex cylinders (10 cm width and 100 cm length) pivoted to ensure vertical position, moored to the bottom with traps positioned in 20 m water depth. Cylinders equipped with exchangeable boxes at lower end, replaced after each sampling interval. Sodium azide was added to trap boxes at deployment to prevent decay of organic matter. Samples kept cool at 4°C for max 48h prior to laboratory treatment."
"F01_AcidExtractable_GlommaCu19","Transport and sedimentation of Cu in Glomma estuary","Fractionation Protocol","Acid extractable fraction/Suspended Particulate Matter","Total Cu content obtained by total digestion with hydrofluoric acid and aqua regia according to Loring and Rantala (1991). Trap samples were washed with distilled water and centrifuged three times to remove salt, freeze-dried, and powdered by use of an agate mortar before analysis."
"E01_AcidDigestion_GlommaCu19","Transport and sedimentation of Cu in Glomma estuary","Extraction Protocol","Acid digestion","Total Cu content obtained by total digestion with hydrofluoric acid and aqua regia according to Loring and Rantala (1991). Trap samples were washed with distilled water and centrifuged three times to remove salt, freeze-dried, and powdered by use of an agate mortar before analysis."
"A01_AtomicAbsorptio_GlommaCu19","Transport and sedimentation of Cu in Glomma estuary","Analytical Protocol","Atomic absorption spectroscopy","Total Cu content obtained by atomic absorption spectrometry after total digestion. Laboratory obtained average value of 26.3±2.4 mg Cu/kg (n=14) on certified value of 25.1±3.8 mg Cu/kg using MESS-1 reference material."
