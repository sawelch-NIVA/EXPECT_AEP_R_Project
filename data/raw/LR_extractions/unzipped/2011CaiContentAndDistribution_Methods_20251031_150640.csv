"S01_Grab_CHINARE200","3rd Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition (CHINARE)","Sampling Protocol","Grab","Surface sediments were collected using a grab sampler and sediments were placed carefully into acid-rinsed glass vials using a plastic spatula and then stored at -20°C before analysis"
"F01_Grab_CHINARE200","3rd Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition (CHINARE)","Fractionation Protocol","Acid-extractable fraction","Sediment sample (0.1 ± 0.001 g, dry weight) was dissolved with 10 mL of HNO3 in an acid-washed PTFE vessel and heated at 180°C until almost dry. HNO3 (1.0 mL) and 2.0 mL of HClO4 were subsequently added and heating continued until a wet paste was formed. Finally, ultra pure water was added and the solution maintained at 180°C until almost dry (this step was repeated three times). After cooling, samples were diluted to 50 mL with HNO3 (1% v/v)"

"A01_Grab_CHINARE200","3rd Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition (CHINARE)","Analytical Protocol","Gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry","Solutions were analyzed with flame atomic absorption spectrometry for Zn, and for Cu, Pb, Cr, Cd and V by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (SOLLAAR M6, Thermo Electron). Detection limit was 0.06 μg L-1 for Cu"
