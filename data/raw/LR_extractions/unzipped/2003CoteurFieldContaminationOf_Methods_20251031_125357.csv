S01_Core_SorfjordSt,"Field contamination of the starfish Asterias rubens by metals in Sørfjord, Norway",Sampling Protocol,Core,Sediment samples were taken by scuba divers below the halocline using a polyvinyl chloride corer. The top 5 cm layer was collected in polyethylene containers and stored at -20°C
S02_Core_SorfjordSt,"Field contamination of the starfish Asterias rubens by metals in Sørfjord, Norway",Sampling Protocol,Point,Starfish were collected by scuba divers and placed in tanks filled with their surrounding water. Tanks were hermetically sealed to avoid osmotic shock due to vertical salinity gradient
A01_Core_SorfjordSt,"Field contamination of the starfish Asterias rubens by metals in Sørfjord, Norway",Analytical Protocol,GFAAS,"Cd, Cu, and Pb analyzed by graphite furnace electrothermic atomic absorption spectrometry (EAAS) using a Varian GTA100 SpectrAA 640Z spectrometer. Chemical modifiers used: 0.018% Pd, 0.009% Mg, and 0.009% P"
E01_Core_SorfjordSt,"Field contamination of the starfish Asterias rubens by metals in Sørfjord, Norway",Extraction Protocol,Microwave-assisted acid digestion,Samples were mineralised by high-pressure microwave method using a Milestone 1200 mega microwave oven. 2.5 ml of Suprapur HNO3 and 1 ml of 30% Suprapur H2O2 were added to Teflon containers with dried samples
F01_Core_SorfjordSt,"Field contamination of the starfish Asterias rubens by metals in Sørfjord, Norway",Fractionation Protocol,Acid extractable,Samples were mineralised by high-pressure microwave method using a Milestone 1200 mega microwave oven. 2.5 ml of Suprapur HNO3 and 1 ml of 30% Suprapur H2O2 were added to Teflon containers with dried samples
