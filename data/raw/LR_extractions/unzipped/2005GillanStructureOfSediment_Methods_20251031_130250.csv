"S01_CoreSampling_SorfjordHM","Sørfjord Heavy Metal Contamination Study","Sampling Protocol","Core sampling","Sediments were collected in March 2003 by SCUBA divers at a depth of 15 m. The top 3-cm layer of the sediments was collected using acid-washed 500-ml polyethylene vials. Six replicate samples were collected at each site."
"F01_CoreSampling_SorfjordHM","Sørfjord Heavy Metal Contamination Study","Fractionation Protocol","Acid-extractable fraction","Aliquots of the dried sediments (500 ± 3 mg) were placed in acid-washed Teflon vials with 10 ml of 0.5 M Suprapur HCl (Merck). The sediments were then agitated at 200 rpm for 1 h at ambient temperature using an orbital shaker."
"E01_CoreSampling_SorfjordHM","Sørfjord Heavy Metal Contamination Study","Extraction Protocol","Acid digestion","Aliquots of the dried sediments (500 ± 3 mg) were placed in acid-washed Teflon vials with 10 ml of 0.5 M Suprapur HCl (Merck). The sediments were then agitated at 200 rpm for 1 h at ambient temperature using an orbital shaker."
"A01_CoreSampling_SorfjordHM","Sørfjord Heavy Metal Contamination Study","Analytical Protocol","Atomic absorption spectroscopy","After centrifugation (10 min at 700 × g), the supernatant was separated and the metal content was determined directly by atomic absorption spectrometry"
