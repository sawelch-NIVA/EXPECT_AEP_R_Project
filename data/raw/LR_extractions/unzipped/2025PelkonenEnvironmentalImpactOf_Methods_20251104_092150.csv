"S01_PointSampling_TaraldrudN","Environmental impact of acid-forming alum shale waste rock legacy site in Norway - Taraldrud site","Sampling Protocol","Point sampling","Stream water sampled at 3 locations. Water samples (unfiltered) for elemental analysis by ICP-MS/MS were collected, transferred to the laboratory, and preserved by acidification to 5% (V/V) with ultrapure concentrated nitric acid on the same day."
"S02_CoreSampling_TaraldrudN","Environmental impact of acid-forming alum shale waste rock legacy site in Norway - Taraldrud site","Sampling Protocol","Core sampling","Soil cores collected by inserting a 30 cm plastic corer tube (ID 11.5 cm) into the soil. Sediment cores collected from the bottom of the pond by inserting 40 cm plastic tubes (ID 5 cm) into the sediment. Cores sectioned into 2-4 cm resolution before further processing."
"E01_Microwaveassist_TaraldrudN","Environmental impact of acid-forming alum shale waste rock legacy site in Norway - Taraldrud site","Extraction Protocol","Microwave-assisted acid digestion","0.2 g of homogenized solid materials digested in a Milestone UltraWAVE using a mixture of ultrapure concentrated HNO3, phosphoric acid (H3PO4), and fluoroboric acid (HBF4) with a 1:2:1 ratio at 260°C for 40 min."
"A01_InductivelyCoup_TaraldrudN","Environmental impact of acid-forming alum shale waste rock legacy site in Norway - Taraldrud site","Analytical Protocol","Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry","Elemental concentrations determined in an Agilent 8900 triple quadrupole ICP mass spectrometer using He and O2 reaction modes. Calibration standards prepared from single-element ICP standards. Bi, In, and Rh used as online internal standards."
"F01_Filtered045um_TaraldrudN","Environmental impact of acid-forming alum shale waste rock legacy site in Norway - Taraldrud site","Fractionation Protocol","Filtered 0.45um","On-site water fractionation performed using <0.45 μm membrane filter (polypropylene membrane) and hollow fiber with membrane cut-off of 10 kDa (polysulfone membrane) to distinguish high molecular mass (HMM) and low molecular mass (LMM) species."
