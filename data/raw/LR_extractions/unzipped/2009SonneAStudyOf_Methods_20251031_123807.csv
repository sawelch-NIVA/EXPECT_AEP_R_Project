"S01_PointSampling_ArcticSeal","Arctic seal metal concentrations and metallothionein binding capacity study","Sampling Protocol","Point sampling","Seals were shot and tissue samples taken and stored within 5 min after the kill. 5 g of liver and kidney wrapped in aluminum foil and preserved in liquid nitrogen for MT analyses. 5 g of liver and kidney collected in PE Whirl-Pak bags and stored at −10 to −20 °C for metal analysis"
"F01_PointSampling_ArcticSeal","Arctic seal metal concentrations and metallothionein binding capacity study","Fractionation Protocol","Acid-extractable fraction","Tissue samples for cadmium, copper and zinc analysis were heat and pressure digested in a HNO3 (65%, Suprapur) and H2O2 (30%, ISO. Merck, Germany) solution (5:1) as described by Berntssen et al. (1999), and mercury analysis samples were digested and stabilized as described by Julshamn and Brenna (2002)"

"A01_PointSampling_ArcticSeal","Arctic seal metal concentrations and metallothionein binding capacity study","Analytical Protocol","Atomic absorption spectroscopy","Copper and zinc analysed by flame atomic absorption on a Perkin-Elmer 3300 AAS (3 replicates per sample). Cadmium concentrations analysed by electrothermal atomic absorption on a Perkin-Elmer 4110ZL, USA (detection limit 0.037 µg l−1) using 0.3% (NH4)2HPO4 and 0.01% Mg matrix modifier. Total mercury analysed by flow injection cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry (FI-CVAAS) on a Perkin-Elmer AS90 Flow Injection Mercury System (detection limit 0.01 mg Hg L-1) using 10% SnCl2 as reductant"
