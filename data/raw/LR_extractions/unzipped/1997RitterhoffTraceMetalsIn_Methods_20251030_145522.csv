"S01_Trawl_ARKIXb1993","Trace metals in zooplankton from Fram Strait and Greenland Sea - ARK IX/Ib cruise","Sampling Protocol","Trawl","Vertically towed bongo net from about 1500 m depth to the surface (mesh size 200 μm and 300 μm; hauling at 0.3 m s-1) and by trawling an oblique rectangular midwater trawl (RMT 1 + 8) from 1000 m depth to the surface at 2 kn (mesh size 200 μm and 300 μm; hauling at 0.5 m s-1)"
"F01_Trawl_ARKIXb1993","Trace metals in zooplankton from Fram Strait and Greenland Sea - ARK IX/Ib cruise","Fractionation Protocol","Thermal/Acid Extractable Fraction","Samples were lyophilised and homogenised using a boron carbide mortar and pestle. Aliquots of about 10 mg dried material were digested for 1 h at 96°C with 50 μl HNO₃ (70-71%, Baker Instra-Analysed) in 1.5 ml Eppendorf reaction tubes"

"A01_Trawl_ARKIXb1993","Trace metals in zooplankton from Fram Strait and Greenland Sea - ARK IX/Ib cruise","Analytical Protocol","GC-MS","Elements Cd, Pb, Ni and Cu were determined using sequential multielement graphite tube atomic absorption spectroscopy (Varian Techtron, AA-975, GTA-95, platform atomisation). For all determinations deuterium background correction was applied."
