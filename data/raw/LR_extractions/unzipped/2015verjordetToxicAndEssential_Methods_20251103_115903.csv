"S01_Other_KittiwakeK","Black-legged kittiwake trace element study Kongsfjorden","Sampling Protocol","Other","Ten adult kittiwakes sampled each month using shot gun. Liver tissue samples immediately dissected out and frozen in liquid nitrogen for MT analysis. Subsequently, samples of liver and pectoralis muscle collected for element and stable isotope analysis."
"F01_Acidextractable_KittiwakeK","Black-legged kittiwake trace element study Kongsfjorden","Fractionation Protocol","Acid-extractable fraction","Muscle and liver tissue lyophilized for 24 h prior to digestion. Dry samples (~0.15 g) transferred to PTFE-vials (18 mL) together with ultrapure water and nitric acid (4.2 g; HNO3; Scanpure) prior to digestion using high pressure microwave emitter (Milestone Ultra Clave, EMLS, Leutkirch, Germany)."
"E01_Microwaveassist_KittiwakeK","Black-legged kittiwake trace element study Kongsfjorden","Extraction Protocol","Microwave-assisted acid digestion","Muscle and liver tissue lyophilized for 24 h prior to digestion. Dry samples (~0.15 g) transferred to PTFE-vials (18 mL) together with ultrapure water and nitric acid (4.2 g; HNO3; Scanpure) prior to digestion using high pressure microwave emitter (Milestone Ultra Clave, EMLS, Leutkirch, Germany)."
"A01_Icpms_KittiwakeK","Black-legged kittiwake trace element study Kongsfjorden","Analytical Protocol","ICP-MS","Total Hg, Cd, Zn, Cu and Se determined by high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (HR–ICP-MS; Thermo Finnigan model Element 2 instrument, Bremen, Germany). Results reported on dry-weight basis."
