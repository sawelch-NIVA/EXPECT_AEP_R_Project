S01_CagedOrganismDe_Flekkefjor,Active biomonitoring of trace elements in Flekkefjord fjord during restoration activities,Sampling Protocol,Caged organism deployment,"Blue mussel individuals (3–5 cm in length) were purchased from a mussel farm located in Kaldvellfjord (Lillesand, Norway). Two cages containing approximately 300 mussels each were placed using buoys, ropes, and weights by a scuba diver at 5- and 15-m depth in five selected locations. Sampling of about 50 mussels per each cage was performed at different time points (t=0, 30, 135, 166, and 196 days). After sampling, mussels were transported to the lab within 1 h, their soft tissues were separated from the shells and pooled in a unique sample per sampling location, depth, and time. Each pool was weighed to determine the wet weight and stored at −20 °C until processing."
F01_AcidFrac_Flekkefjor,Active biomonitoring of trace elements in Flekkefjord fjord during restoration activities,Fractionation Protocol,Acid-extractable fraction,"A total of 0.3 g of each sample was mineralized by an ultrawave single reaction chamber microwave digestion system (Anton Paar MULTIWAVE 3000, Anton Paar GmbH, Graz, Austria) in Teflon tubes filled with 10 ml of HNO3 (65% concentrated) by applying a one-step temperature ramp (at 120 °C in 10 min and maintained for 10 min). The mineralized samples were cooled for 20 min and the homogenous sample solutions were transferred into polypropylene test tubes."
E01_MicrowaveAcid_Flekkefjor,Active biomonitoring of trace elements in Flekkefjord fjord during restoration activities,Extraction Protocol,Microwave-assisted acid digestion,"A total of 0.3 g of each sample was mineralized by an ultrawave single reaction chamber microwave digestion system (Anton Paar MULTIWAVE 3000, Anton Paar GmbH, Graz, Austria) in Teflon tubes filled with 10 ml of HNO3 (65% concentrated) by applying a one-step temperature ramp (at 120 °C in 10 min and maintained for 10 min). The mineralized samples were cooled for 20 min and the homogenous sample solutions were transferred into polypropylene test tubes."
A01_ICPMS_Flekkefjor,Active biomonitoring of trace elements in Flekkefjord fjord during restoration activities,Analytical Protocol,Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,"Samples (250 μL) were diluted 1:40 (v/v) with a standard solution containing an internal standard (100 μL) and H2O (9.75 mL). An aliquot of 2 mg/L of internal standard solution (72Ge, 89Y, 159 Tb) was added to obtain a final concentration of 20 mg/L. All samples were analysed in triplicate by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Bruker Aurora M90 ICP-MS, Bremen, Germany). The typical polyatomical analysis interferences were removed using the collision-reaction interface (CRI) with an H2 flow of 75 mL/min through a skimmer cone."
