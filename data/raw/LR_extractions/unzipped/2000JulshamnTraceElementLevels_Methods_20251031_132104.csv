"S01_Biopsy_GreenlandS","Trace element levels in harp seal and hooded seal from Greenland Sea study","Sampling Protocol","Biopsy","The seals were autopsied at the catch sites and samples of muscle, liver and kidney were taken after a standardised procedure. Meat samples were taken from deep inside the central dorsal, liver samples from the right ventral lobe and kidney samples from the anterior tip of the kidney. The weight of all samples was approximately 100 g."
"F01_Biopsy_GreenlandS","Trace element levels in harp seal and hooded seal from Greenland Sea study","Fractionation Protocol","Acid-extractable fraction","Biological samples for element analyses were digested in a mixture of concentrated nitric and perchloric acids (suprapure quality, 9+1) as described by Julshamn et al. (1982)."
"E01_Biopsy_GreenlandS","Trace element levels in harp seal and hooded seal from Greenland Sea study","Extraction Protocol","Acid digestion","Biological samples for element analyses were digested in a mixture of concentrated nitric and perchloric acids (suprapure quality, 9+1) as described by Julshamn et al. (1982)."
"A01_Biopsy_GreenlandS","Trace element levels in harp seal and hooded seal from Greenland Sea study","Analytical Protocol","Atomic absorption spectroscopy","Iron, copper and zinc were determined by acetylene-air-flame atomic absorption (Perkin-Elmer Model 3030B AAS). Standard curves were used for the determination of copper."
