Solbergstrand_Brooks_Mussel_Source,Location of Blue mussel collection/culturing with filtered seawater.,"Coastal, fjord","Water column, pelagic zone",Norway,Not relevant,59.6162,10.6491,WGS 84,0,m,Sam Welch,31/10/2025,Mussels used in biomonitoring were collected from the vicinity of Solbergstrand station and cultured in filtered seawater. It is presumed that copper concentrations in this seawater will be roughly equivalent to fjord conditions.
