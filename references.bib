  abstract = {The area along the Norwegian-Russian border is threatened by air pollution from emission sources on the Kola Peninsula. A permanent network of 78 systematically chosen monitoring sites has been established in eastern Finnmark, Norway. Species abundance data from the ground vegetation have been recorded from 1320 systematically chosen permanent plots inside 66 of these sites, using frequency in subplots and visual estimates of percentage cover. Environmental variables were obtained for the whole site. Multivariate data analysis has been used to describe the variation in the species composition and to study its relation to environmental variables and pollution impact. The analyses show that much of the variation in the species composition, based on average species abundance at the sites, is well explained by different soil and climatic conditions. However, estimated SO2 deposition, Ni, and Cu in the soil, and Ni in Cladina tissue have also been found to be statistically significantly correlated with the variation in the species data, but they explain only a minor part of the variation. The pollution impact over several years may have lead to a reduced lichen cover in the bottom-layer vegetation. Further development in an either negative or positive direction can be detected by re-investigations of the monitoring sites.},

WoE evaluation or SR is promoted in seven of the investigated frameworks but sufficient guidance for how to perform these processes is generally lacking. None of the investigated frameworks give enough guidance for generating robust and reproducible WoE evaluations or SRs. In conclusion, the foundation for use of WoE evaluation and SR is laid in the majority of the investigated frameworks, but there is a need to provide more structured and detailed guidance. In order to make the process of developing guidance as efficient as possible, and to ensure smooth transfer of risk assessment's between frameworks if a chemical is risk assessed both as, for example, a biocide and an industrial chemical, it is recommended that guidance is developed jointly by the European regulatory agencies.},

A simplified impact assessment is outlined, where predicted environmental concentrations of individual chemicals and whole effluent concentrations of scrubber discharge water are compared to predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) or lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC). The 2018 assessment shows scrubber effluent concentrations exceeding LOEC in Baltic and North Sea coastal regions. By 2050, assuming high use of scrubbers, elevated concentrations may extend to all European seas. For AFPs, assuming continued use of primarily copper-based paints, the highest copper concentrations are projected in 2050 for North Sea ports and coasts, potentially exceeding PNECs.},

  abstract = {Natural organic matter (NOM), expressed as dissolved organic carbon (DOC in mgC L-1), is an ubiquitous complexing agent in natural waters, and is now recognized as an important factor mitigating water-borne metal toxicity. However, the magnitude of the protective effect, judged by toxicity measures (e.g. LC50), varies substantially among different NOM sources even for similar DOC concentrations, implying a potential role of NOM physicochemical properties or quality of NOM. This review summarizes some key quality parameters for NOM samples, obtained by reverse osmosis, and by using correlation analyses, investigates their contribution to ameliorating metal toxicity towards aquatic biota. At comparable and environmentally realistic DOC levels, molecular spectroscopic characteristics (specific absorbance coefficient, SAC, and fluorescence index, FI) as well as concentrations of fluorescent fractions obtained from mathematical mixture resolution techniques (PARAFAC), explain considerable variability in the protective effects. NOM quality clearly influences the toxicity of copper (Cu) and lead (Pb). NOM quality may also influence the toxicity of silver (Ag), cadmium (Cd) and inorganic mercury (Hg), but as yet insufficient data are available to unequivocally support the latter correlations between toxicity reduction and NOM quality predictors. Cu binding capacities, protein-to-carbohydrate ratio, and lipophilicity, show insignificant correlation to the amelioration offered by NOMs, but these conclusions are based on data for Norwegian NOMs with very narrow ranges for the latter two parameters. Certainly, various NOMs alleviate metal toxicity differentially and therefore their quality measures should be considered in addition to their quantity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In order to optimise the usefulness of the ecological information held by foraminifera and enable characterisation of temporal changes in environmental quality beyond time intervals covered by biological time-series, the Norwegian governmental macrofauna-based classification system is applied on fossil benthic foraminiferal assemblages. Quantitative comparisons demonstrate deteriorating ecological status in response to increased anthropogenic forcing (eutrophication, micropollutants), including a 73\% loss in number of foraminiferal species. Despite reduced pollution during the past decades and, at one site, capping of polluted sediments with clean clay, the reference conditions are far from re-established. Micropalaeontological monitoring requires net sediment accumulation basins and careful considerations of taphonomic processes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Concentrations of trace elements and contaminants of emerging concern, benzotriazoles and benzothiazoles (BTRs and BTHs), were assessed. Metal concentrations of Al, As, Cr, Hg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, V, and Zn in marine sediment were up to two or three times higher than in riverine sediment and most of them showed an increasing trend from the upper to the lower part of the river. Pb (0.058 mu g/L) and Zn (0.80 mu g/L) were present in levels of moderate pollution in seawater close to town, while Cu (0.11 mu g/L) exceeded background levels in the same area. As (0.042 mu g/L), Hg (0.004 mu g/L) and Cd (0.011 mu g/L) showed levels of low to moderate pollution in freshwater from the river. In seawater and river water detected BTRs and BTHs were: BTR, TTR, 2-OH-BTH, XTR, 2-Me-S-BTH, 2-M-BTH, 2-S-BTH, and 2-NH2- BTH. Considerably high concentrations of BTR (1460 ng/L) and 2-OH-BTH (1070 ng/L) were found. Compounds present in marine and riverine sediment were BTR, 2-OH-BTH, 2-Me-S-BTH, and 2-M-BTH. Sediment appeared to be a significant sink of BTRs and BTHs with a concentration range of 1.13-32.7 ng/g. A trend of higher concentrations of trace elements in sediment (ANOVA, p = 0.044) and seawater (ANOVA, p = 0.013), as well as 2OH-BTH in seawater (t-test, p = 0.010) was observed in the vicinity of the town, where most anthropogenic activities have taken place due to former mining operations.},

Metallothioneins are low-molecular-weight, cysteine-rich proteins known to be induced by high environmental levels of trace metals. Specimens of Macoma balthica and Mytilus edulis were collected along several Arctic estuaries in the White and Pechora seas; whole tissues for AL balthica and the digestive gland and gills for Al. edulis were dissected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized onboard. Metallothionein concentrations were determined by a polarographic assay. From the same stations organisms and sediments were also collected for metal analysis. The results revealed significant differences in metallothionein concentrations among the stations for Al, balthica. Similar, although less marked, differences were also obtained in the organs of M. edulis. Data on metallothionein were compared with trace metal concentrations in both the organisms and sediments. Also, the relationship with abiotic factors (salinity) and biological variables (size of sampled organisms) was determined. In particular, biological variables seemed to influence metallothionein concentration in the organisms and their effect should be carefully considered for a correct assessment of differences between stations.

We have collated published information on MT in three important groups of aquatic invertebrates---the molluscs, crustaceans and annelid worms, and attempted to seek explanations for some of the apparent inconsistencies present in the dataset. MTs can be induced by the essential metals Cu and Zn and the non-essential metals Cd, Ag and Hg in both vertebrates and invertebrates, but their induction is variable. Such variation is intraspecific and interspecific, and is down to a variety of reasons environmental and physiological explored here. Against this background of variability MTs do appear to play roles both in the routine metabolic handling of essential Cu and Zn, but also in the detoxification of excess amounts intracellularly of these metals and of non-essential Cd, Ag and Hg. Different isoforms of MT probably play different physiological roles, and the dependence on MT in detoxification processes varies environmentally and between zoological groups. MTs can be used as biomarkers if used wisely in well-designed environmental monitoring programmes.},

  abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and in situ fluorescence were measured along with hydrographic parameters in the Greenland, Iceland, and Norwegian Seas (Nordic Seas). Surface ({$<$}100 m) concentrations of DOC ranged from 60 to 118 {$\mu$}M with elevated values in the East Greenland Current (EGC) which transports water from the Arctic Ocean to the North Atlantic. EGC surface waters also showed a pronounced fluorescence maximum between 30 and 120 m depth in all EGC sections indicating the abundance of Arctic river derived DOC in this current. Based on fluorescence we estimated that 20--50\% of the annual river discharge to the Arctic Ocean was exported in the EGC. The fluorescence maximum was typically associated with salinity around 33 and temperatures below -1{$^\circ$}C which are characteristic of surface and upper halocline water in the Arctic Ocean. The elevated fluorescence in this water mass suggests a strong Eurasian shelf component and also suggests that in situ fluorescence could be used to trace Eurasian shelf water in the central Arctic Ocean. DOC concentrations in the Nordic Sea basins ({$>$}1000 m) were relatively high ({$\sim$}50 {$\mu$}M DOC) compared with other ocean basins indicating active vertical transport of DOC in this region on decadal timescales. Based on existing vertical transport estimates and 15 {$\mu$}M of semilabile DOC we calculated an annual vertical net DOC export of 3.5 Tg C yr-1 in the Greenland Sea and about 36 Tg C yr-1 for the entire Arctic Mediterranean Sea (AMS) including the Greenland-Scotland Ridge overflow. It appears that physical processes play a determining role for the distribution of DOC in the AMS.},

The sampling stations were chosen to be representative of different glacial runoff, anthropic impact and possible influence of Atlantic waters. It was found that Al, Ca, Co, Fe, K, Mg, Ti and V enter the fjord by the natural input of lithogenic particles from the glaciers, whereas Cd, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni and Zn of anthropogenic origin are mainly introduced through the intrusion of Atlantic waters. The study of metal availability in surface sediments indicated that the labile fraction, leachable in weak acidic conditions, represents only a minor portion ({$<$} 14 \%) of the total element concentration, except for Cd, Cu and Mn.},

In the most polluted parts of the river the concentration levels of Cu and Zn in 1986-1987 were up to 155 mug l-1 and 186 mug l-1, respectively.  In 1989 the spoil heaps in the mining area were covered with protective layers of moss-covered plastic.  In 1991-1992 the concentration levels of Cu and Zn had decreased by 75\% and 65\%, respectively.  Animal life in the polluted area seemed to be strongly affected by the trace metals in 1986-1987.  The 1991-1992 results showed a marked increase in the number of species and in the number of individuals of each species of Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera, compared with the results from 1986-87.  Good correlations were found between the concentrations of Cu in the water and both the number of species and the number of individuals of Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera.  Analysis of the species Baetis rhodani, Diura nanseni and Rhyacophila nubila showed an average total dry weight content of Cu up to 264 mug g-1, of Zn up to 1930 mug g-1 and of Cd up to 16 mug g-1.  The contents of the three trace metals were significantly different from one species to another and in part between the stations for each species.  In 1987 trout died after an exposure of one to two days on three test sites in the river, whereas in 1991-1992 40-75\% of the trout survived an exposure period of several weeks at two of the sites.  Electrofishing in 1991-1992 indicated recolonization of trout in the lower parts of the former affected and uninhabitable area.},

Consequently, the US EPA has proposed its use for calculating freshwater copper criteria. This study evaluates the BLM for use in estuarine and marine waters. Studies were conducted using the bivalve, Mytilus sp. and 48-h embryo-larval development chronic estimator test methods. These are the most sensitive taxa and test in the US EPA saltwater copper criteria database. Samples from five locations around the USA were tested. There is a strong relationship between measured and BLM predicted copper EC50s (log transformed data, r2=0.76, p{$<$}0.001, n=44). The BLM predicted within a factor {\textpm}2 of measured EC50s in 41 of 44 cases. However, the BLM tends to predict lower EC50s when measured EC50s are approximately {$\leq$}10{$\mu$}gCu/L.

TLDR: There is a strong relationship between measured and BLM predicted copper EC50s (log transformed data, r(2)=0.76, p{$<$}0.001, n=44), however, the BLM tends to predict lowerEC50s when measured EC 50s are approximately {$<$} or =10 microg Cu/L, due to limitations of the metal-dissolved organic matter interaction model.\\
remark: According to big copper, the BLM is pretty good at predicting Cu toxicity to mussels in estuarine/marine waters.},

  abstract = {The Fram Strait represents the major gateway of Arctic Ocean waters towards the Nordic Seas and North Atlantic Ocean and is a key region to study the impact of climate change on biogeochemical cycles. In the region, in-formation about trace metal speciation, such as copper, is scarce. This manuscript presents the concentrations and conditional stability constants of copper-binding ligands (LCu and log KcondCu2+L) in the water column of Fram Strait and the Greenland shelf (GEOTRACES cruise GN05). Cu-binding ligands were analysed by Competitive Ligand Exchange-Adsorptive Cathodic Stripping Voltammetry (CLE-ACSV) using salicylaldoxime (SA) as competitive ligand. Based on water masses and the hydrodynamic influences, three provinces were considered (coast, shelf, and Fram Strait) and differences were observed between regions and water masses. The strongest variability was observed in surface waters, with increasing LCu concentrations (mean values: Fram Strait = 2.6 +/- 1.0 nM; shelf = 5.2 +/- 1.3 nM; coast = 6.4 +/- 0.8 nM) and decreasing log KcondCu2+L values (mean values: Fram Strait = 15.7 +/- 0.3; shelf = 15.2 +/- 0.3; coast = 14.8 +/- 0.3) towards the west. The surface LCu concentrations obtained above the Greenland shelf indicate a supply from the coastal environment to the Polar Surface Water (PSW) which is an addition to the ligand exported from the central Arctic to Fram Strait. The significant differences (in terms of LCu and log Kcond Cu2+L) between shelf and coastal samples were explained considering the processes which modify ligand concentrations and binding strengths, such as biological activity in sea-ice, phytoplankton bloom in surface waters, bacterial degradation, and meltwater discharge from 79NG glacier terminus. Overall, the ligand concentration exceeded those of dissolved Cu (dCu) and kept the free copper (Cu2+) concentrations at femtomolar levels (0.13-21.13 fM). This indicates that Cu2+ toxicity limits were not reached and dCu levels were stabilized in surface waters by organic complexes, which favoured its transport to the Nordic Seas and North Atlantic Ocean and the development of microorganism.},

  abstract = {The Arctic Ocean is a unique biogeochemical environment characterized by low salinity surface waters, extensive sea-ice coverage, high riverine inputs, large shelf extension and the long residence time of deep waters. These characteristics determine the distribution of dissolved bio-essential trace metals, such as copper (Cu), and the dissolved organic-binding ligands capable of complexing it. This work reports the concentrations and conditional stability constants of dissolved Cu-binding ligands (L-Cu and log K-Cu2+L(cond)) measured in samples from the Polarstern (PS94) expedition, as part of the international GEOTRACES program (cruise GN04). Full-depth profile stations from the Barents Sea, Nansen Basin, Amundsen Basin and Makarov Basin were analysed by competitive ligand exchange-adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (CLE-AdCSV). The basins and water masses presented a wide range of L-Cu concentrations (range: 1.40 - 7.91 nM) and log K-Cu2+L(cond) values (range: 13.83 - 16.01). The highest variability of Cu-binding ligand concentrations was observed in surface waters ({$<$}= 200 m), and mean concentrations increased from the Barents Sea and Nansen Basin (2.15 +/- 0.31 nM and 1.93 +/- 0.35 nM, respectively) to the Amundsen (3.84 +/- 1.69 nM) and Makarov Basins (4.40 +/- 2.03 nM). The influence of the Transpolar Drift (TDP) flow path was observed in the Amundsen and Makarov Basins, especially on Cu-binding ligand concentrations (L-Cu range: 3.96 - 7.91 nM). In contrast, deep waters ({$>$}200 m) showed no significant differences between basins and water masses in terms of L-Cu concentrations (range: 1.45 - 2.78 nM) and log K-Cu2+L(cond) (range: 14.02 - 15.46). The presence of strong Cu-binding ligands (log K-Cu2+L(cond){$>$}13) in surface waters stabilises the excess of dissolved copper (dCu) transported in the TPD and favours its export to the Fram Strait and Nordic Seas.},

The distribution profiles of organic compounds and inorganic elements were explored in marine surface sediments collected in proximity of two active Norwegian fish farms, Hest{\o}ya and N{\o}rholmen ({$<$}200-1100~m from the perimeter edge of the installations). Overall, the sediment organic matter (SOM) content was 7.3~{\textpm}~4.9\%, with 7.9~{\textpm}~5.1\% and 4.0~{\textpm}~0.5\% for Hest{\o}ya and N{\o}rholmen, respectively. A non-targeted analysis was performed for screening organic compounds in marine sediments, and the presence of 60 compounds was detected. Among suspect compounds were alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, aldehydes, ketones, esters, alcohols, diols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), terpenes and terpenoids. Heptanal, benzaldehyde, 4-oxoisophorone, 1,7-dimethylnaphthalene and 3-bromophenol were the most abundant compounds in marine sediments. In total, concentrations of 47 elements were measured, concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mo, Ni, Sn and Zn were strongly influenced by anthropogenic inputs, while concentrations of Ce, Co, Al, Fe and Ti were related to the geology of the local bedrock. The chemical composition of marine sediments was different at Hest{\o}ya and N{\o}rholmen, indicating different anthropogenic inputs in these areas. In general, concentrations of toxic elements were below the proposed guidelines for Norwegian marine sediment quality and can be characterised as background pollution. Overall, fish-farming activities had only a minor or negligible influence on marine sediments and are unlikely to cause any harm to local aquatic life in the studied area.},

Nickel and copper sediment pollution in the mine tailing sea disposal area was classified as moderate and severe, respectively, under Norwegian environmental quality standards, and highlights the persistent hazard and legacy impacts of heavy metals in these impacted fjord ecosystems. Mercury, zinc, and arsenic had stronger affinities to brown crab muscle likely due to the presence of thiols, and availability of metal binding sites. Our multi -isotopic composition data showed that lead isotopes were the most useful source apportionment tool for this fjord. Overall, our study highlights the importance and value of measuring several different heavy metals and multiple isotopic signatures in different crab organs and seafloor sediment to comprehensively evaluate fjord pollution and kinetic uptake dynamics. Brown crabs were suitable eco-indicators of benthic ecosystem heavy metal pollution in a fjord ecosystem still experiencing short- and long-term physical and chemical impacts from coastal mining sea disposal activities.},

The genus has a worldwide distribution, and some species play an important role as a link in trophic webs. It is well established that many crustaceans are able to survive in contaminated environments by storing metallic pollutants in detoxified form, and thus, they may represent a source of contaminants for their predators. The present study was designed to determine the distribution of bioaccumulated metals, both essential and nonessential, with a view to assessing their availability to the next trophic level. Groups of 1000-1500 adult copepods were exposed for 1-14 days to Ag, Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, and Zn in water. Three concentrations, chosen to be realistic in comparison with those encountered in polluted environments, were tested for each metal. Copepods were homogenized and metals were analyzed in supernatants (i.e., metals stored in soluble form in soft tissues or easily remobilized from the exoskeleton) and pellets (including metal-rich detoxificatory granules or with cellular debris) recovered after centrifugation. Another experiment, consisting of desorption tests, was designed to evaluate the fraction of metals loosely bound onto the exoskeleton. The bioaccumulation ability is highly variable, as shown by the ratios between the concentrations reached in T brevicornis experimentally exposed to different metals (at higher dose and at day 14) and those in controls (7, 12, 18, 26, 53, and 99, respectively, for Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd, Ag, and Hg). Cu, Zn, and Ni concentrations in copepods increased linearly with time over the whole range of exposure concentrations, whereas a plateau body metal concentration was reached with time particularly at the highest exposure concentrations for Cd, Ag, and Hg. Metals bound onto the exoskeleton were remobilized to different extents, the percentages of desorption being 11, 14, 16, 19, 31, and 32, respectively, for Zn, Cd, Cu, Ni, Ag, and Hg. Metals mainly present in the supernatant (Cd, Ni, Zn) are probably more able to be transferred along a food chain than those which were equally distributed between soluble and insoluble fractions (Ag, Cu, and Hg).

Selenium was found to biomagnify, exceeding maximum permitted concentrations for human consumption within carnivorous fish tissue, the highest trophic level examined.

Copper, cadmium, zinc and lead concentrations were below concentrations shown to elicit adverse responses in biota. Copper concentrations within crustaceans M. bennettae and P. palagicus were found to exceed maximum permitted concentrations for human consumption. It is likely that copper concentrations within these species were accumulated due to the essential nature of this trace metal for many species of molluscs and crustaceans. Arsenic showed some evidence of biomagnification.

  abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the third contributor to cumulative carbon emission reductions required by the second half of this century. Although this is a promising technology for reducing atmospheric CO(2), it is only affordable if the confinement of the gas is guaranteed for hundreds of years. Hence, it is of paramount importance to figure out and predict the chemical and biological effects associated with potential CO(2) leakage, to provide decision makers with a good basis for choosing technology and potential storage sites. To this end, a titanium reactor (1.4\,m(3)) was used to study CO(2) seepage under realistic sub-seabed conditions (30\,bar pressure and 7\,{$^\circ$}C). The injection of CO(2) was calibrated to decrease the pH value from 8.1 to 7.3, which may be the pH found near a leakage point. This pH value also coincides with predictions for near-future ocean pH under current CO(2) emissions worldwide. The results from this study demonstrate that there are some elements, i.e., Fe, Co, Pb, Ce, Zn and Cu, present in deep marine sediments, that are strongly affected by the reduced pH levels related to CO(2) addition. The dissolved concentrations of Fe, Pb and, to a lesser extent, Cr increased, due probably to weakening of the Fe/Mn shuttle by increased dissolved concentrations of CO(2). Desorption processes from oxyhydroxide surfaces due to acidification may explain the release of Co, Ni and Ce observed during the experiment. The increased CO(2) concentration also led to increased metal bioavailability, suggested by higher values for labile metal species. Conversely, Cd mobility seems not to be affected by CO(2)-associated acidification. It is concluded that the determination of those elements most affected by CO(2)-related acidification in a sub-seabed CO(2) storage perimeter (i.e., sediment, sediment-water interface and water column) would be a simple and effective technique to verify suspected leakage.},

For this purpose, two surveys were carried out in June and September 2012, measuring hydrographic, biological and chemical parameters along the water column at representative sites. The sources of trace elements were evaluated by measuring (208)pb/(207)pb and (206)pb/(207)pb isotope ratios and comparing them with the isotopic signature of the atmospheric particulate and marine sediments collected in the same area.It was found that natural input from the glaciers is the major source for Al, Co, Fe, K, Ti and V, whereas Ba, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb and Zn of anthropogenic origin are mainly introduced into the fjord through the intrusion of Atlantic waters. The influence of the glacial runoff decreased with the distance from the front and it was higher at the end of the summer season than in late spring. On the other hand, the effect of the Atlantic waters was more relevant in the bottom layer at the entrance of the fjord, especially during the summer season. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Trace elements associated to suspended particulate matter have been investigated in the marine environment of Kongsfjorden (Svalbard Islands, Norwegian Arctic), in order to provide detailed information on their spatial variability and a quantitative assessment of the natural and anthropogenic sources. During a survey in July 2014, hydrographic and biogeochemical parameters were measured in addition to trace metals along the water column at eight representative sites and the contribution of the natural and anthropogenic sources was quantified by measuring (208)pb/(207)pb and (206)pb/(207)pb isotope ratios.Al, Co, Fe, K, and V were strongly affected by glacial run-off and their content decreased moving from the inner to the outer basin. Conversely, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn were significantly enriched compared to crustal values and their concentration was higher in the outer part of the fjord. Maximum contribution for anthropogenic particulate Pb ({$>$}85\%) was recorded in the upper 100 m of the water column in the outer part of the fjord. On the other hand, the contribution for terrigenous particulate Pb to surface waters was highest in the innermost station (similar to 60\%), close to the glacier front, and decreased linearly (R-2 = 0.952, p-value {$<$} 0.0001) with distance from Kongsvegen terminus.

One of the fundamental questions in ecotoxicology is to decide what one should measure to detect response in ecosystems exposed to human disturbance. In this paper we use field data to estimate threshold levels eliciting effects on soft bottom macrobenthos collected at different sediment types and depths on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and test these against natural levels occurring levels in reference conditions. SQGs are presented from multivariate analyses based on 121 gradients (represented with Ba, THC, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) incorporating more than 2000 species. Clear clusters with slightly disturbed communities related to contamination loadings were evident in 35\% of the gradients. We found large variations in naturally occurring contamination concentrations and in the threshold levels electing effects on the fauna at different sediment types and depths. For example, an increase in depth of only 100 m can triple the Cu and Zn concentrations that elicit effects. Lowest background and threshold levels were found in shallow, sandy sediment. Our results suggest that current SQGs are too high. We hypothesised that setting a SQG of 4-times background concentrations will give sufficient protection for the fauna from metal contamination. The overall background concentration eliciting effects on metal was 3.6x. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {There are two possible techniques to estimate the degree of authigenic (or non-lithogenic) metal enrichment in sediments. First, the authigenic metal fraction can be calculated according to M-auth = M-total - (M/Al-background center dot Al-total) while M is the metal of interest and Al is aluminum. Second, a metal enrichment factor (EF) is calculated according to EF = M/Al-total/M/Al-background. Both techniques rely on the appropriate use of the M/Al ratio of the lithogenic background. For the latter, the M/Al ratio of average shale or crust is widely applied as lithogenic background in marine geochemistry. However, as we show here, the lithogenic background based on average shale or crust is too high for Cu and Ni. As a consequence, the authigenic fraction of Cu and Ni in sediments and suspended particulate matter (SPM) is significantly underestimated as shown for examples from various environments (upwelling areas of Peru, Chile and the Gulf of California, the Norwegian Kyllaren fjord and the German Wadden Sea). By correlating Cu/Al and Ni/Al with TOC in the samples the apparent M/Al ratio of the background can be estimated. A prerequisite for this technique is high linearity and high quality of correlation (r(2){$>$}= 0.8) otherwise the lithogenic background cannot be exactly determined. The resulting higher authigenic level of Cu and Ni may promote their use as productivity indicators while the status of Cu and Ni may shift from moderately to highly enriched when the enrichment is assessed via EFs.

There is an increasing demand for CCS sites. Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge of the environmental risk associated with potential leakage of CO2 from the storage sites; and even more, what happens when the seepage stops. Can the environment return to the initial equilibrium? Potential effects on native macrofauna were studied under a scenario of a 50-day CO2 leakage, and the subsequent leak closure. To accomplish the objective, Trondheim Fjord sediments and clams were exposed to an acidified environment (pH 6.9) at 29 atm for 7 weeks followed by a 14-day recovery at normal seawater conditions (pH 8.0, 29 atm). Growth and survival of clams exposed to pressure (29 atm) and reduced pH (6.9) did not significantly differ from control clams kept at 1 atm in natural seawater. Furthermore, bioaccumulation of elements in the soft tissue of clams did not register significant variations for most of the analysed elements (Cd, Cr, Pb, and Ti), while other elements (As, Cu, Fe, Ni) had decreasing concentrations in tissues under acidified conditions in contrast to Na and Mg, which registered an uptake (Ku) of 111 and 9.92 mu g g(-1)dw d(-1), respectively. This Ku may be altered due to the stress induced by acidification; and the element concentration being released from sediments was not highly affected at that pH. Therefore, a 1 unit drop in pH at the seafloor for several weeks does not appear to pose a risk for the clams. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Zinc showed the highest absolute concentrations in all samples (mean, 11.2-26.7 mu g/g in muscle, depending on species and area), followed by copper (5.2-7.5 mu g/g), arsenic (0.5-5.4 mu g/g), selenium (1.0-5.8 mu g/g), rubidium (1.4-2.2 mu g/g), and cadmium (0.04-1.2 mu g/g).

Whereas some elements (e.g., mercury and zinc) increased in absolute and standardized concentrations with trophic level in the northern Baffin Bay, most elements showed no relationship with trophic level or other dietary descriptors. In absolute concentrations, nonessential elements differed between regions, whereas essential elements differed among species but not within a species across the two regions. Standardized concentrations (element pattern) of both essential elements and nonessential elements generally did not differ between regions but was highly species specific and, thus, determined by the phylogenetic element regulation capacity. The usefulness of multivariate ordination in element wildlife studies is illustrated, which provides additional insight regarding element co-occurrence in wildlife, allows inclusion of species with low sample number, and reduces the possibility of type II1 errors created by low sample size.},

Trophic magnification factors (TMFs) were suggested as a more reliable tool for bioaccumulation assessment of chemicals that have been in commerce long enough to be quantitatively measured in environmental samples. TMFs are increasingly used to quantify biomagnification and represent the average diet-to-consumer transfer of a chemical through food webs. They differ from biomagnification factors, which apply to individual species and can be highly variable between predator--prey combinations. The TMF is calculated from the slope of a regression between the chemical concentration and trophic level of organisms in the food web. The trophic level can be determined from stable N isotope ratios ({$\delta$}15N). In this article, we give the background for the development of TMFs, identify and discuss impacts of ecosystem and ecological variables on their values, and discuss challenges and uncertainties associated with contaminant measurements and the use of {$\delta$}15N for trophic level estimations. Recommendations are provided for experimental design, data treatment, and statistical analyses, including advice for users on reporting and interpreting TMF data. Interspecies intrinsic ecological and organismal properties such as thermoregulation, reproductive status, migration, and age, particularly among species at higher trophic levels with high contaminant concentrations, can influence the TMF (i.e., regression slope). Following recommendations herein for study design, empirical TMFs are likely to be useful for understanding the food web biomagnification potential of chemicals, where the target is to definitively identify if chemicals biomagnify (i.e., TMF\,\&gt;\,or\,\&lt;\,1).

  abstract = {As part of a broader investigation into recent environmental change on Svalbard, the inorganic geochemical record of six lake-sediment cores was analysed. The major temporal trends in sediment elemental composition are driven by variations in two contrasting sediment components, both derived from catchment soils: (1) mineral matter, and (2) soil organic matter (SOM), enriched in Fe and Mn oxides and heavy metals. Two environmental impacts are recorded in most or all of the lake sediment sequences. An up-core increase in organic matter can be partly attributed to diagenetic effects, but also requires an enhanced supply of SOM relative to mineral matter. In addition, the central and southern sites all show a ca. 1970 event characterised by an enhanced mineral matter accumulation rate. This requires either an enhanced allochthonous supply or an enhanced mobilisation of littoral sediments. In either case a regional-scale driving force, such as a shift in climate, is required. At five of the lakes the sediment heavy metal concentration profiles can be explained entirely by natural factors. However, at Tenndammen (U), situated close to the Svalbard's largest settlement at Longyearbyen, possible anthropogenic Pb enrichment is found. Comparison of observed and expected heavy metal profiles (based on Greenland ice-core data) shows that the lakes are generally too insensitive to have recorded a long-transported heavy metal pollution signal.},

  abstract = {In the present review, we synthesize information on the mechanisms of chronic copper (Cu) toxicity using an adverse outcome pathway framework and identify three primary pathways for chronic Cu toxicity: disruption of sodium homeostasis, effects on bioenergetics, and oxidative stress. Unlike acute Cu toxicity, disruption of sodium homeostasis is not a driving mechanism of chronic toxicity, but compensatory responses in this pathway contribute to effects on organism bioenergetics. Effects on bioenergetics clearly contribute to chronic Cu toxicity with impacts at multiple lower levels of biological organization. However, quantitatively translating these impacts into effects on apical endpoints such as growth, amphibian metamorphosis, and reproduction remains elusive and requires further study. Copper-induced oxidative stress occurs in most tissues of aquatic vertebrates and is clearly a significant driver of chronic Cu toxicity. Although antioxidant responses and capacities differ among tissues, there is no clear indication that specific tissues are more sensitive than others to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress leads to increased apoptosis and cellular damage in multiple tissues, including some that contribute to bioenergetic effects. This also includes oxidative damage to tissues involved in neuroendocrine axes and this damage likely alters the normal function of these tissues. Importantly, Cu-induced changes in hormone concentrations and gene expression in endocrine-mediated pathways such as reproductive steroidogenesis and amphibian metamorphosis are likely the result of oxidative stress-induced tissue damage and not endocrine disruption. Overall, we conclude that oxidative stress is likely the primary driver of chronic Cu toxicity in aquatic vertebrates, with bioenergetic effects and compensatory response to disruption of sodium homeostasis contributing to some degree to observed effects on apical endpoints.

  abstract = {Biotic Ligand Models (BLMs) for metals are widely applied in ecological risk assessments and in the development of regulatory water quality guidelines in Europe, and in 2007 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recommended BLM-based water quality criteria (WQC) for Cu in freshwater. However, to-date, few states have adopted BLM-based Cu criteria into their water quality standards on a state-wide basis, which appears to be due to the perception that the BLM is too complicated or requires too many input variables. Using the mechanistic BLM framework to first identify key water chemistry parameters that influence Cu bioavailability, namely dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pH, and hardness, we developed Cu criteria using the same basic methodology used by the USEPA to derive hardness-based criteria but with the addition of DOC and pH. As an initial proof of concept, we developed stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR) models for species that have been tested over wide ranges of DOC, pH, and hardness conditions. These models predicted acute Cu toxicity values that were within a factor of {\textpm}2 in 77\% to 97\% of tests (5 species had adequate data) and chronic Cu toxicity values that were within a factor of {\textpm}2 in 92\% of tests (1 species had adequate data). This level of accuracy is comparable to the BLM. Following USEPA guidelines for WQC development, the species data were then combined to develop a linear model with pooled slopes for each independent parameter (i.e., DOC, pH, and hardness) and species-specific intercepts using Analysis of Covariance. The pooled MLR and BLM models predicted species-specific toxicity with similar precision; adjusted R2 and R2 values ranged from 0.56 to 0.86 and 0.66--0.85, respectively. Graphical exploration of relationships between predicted and observed toxicity, residuals and observed toxicity, and residuals and concentrations of key input parameters revealed many similarities and a few key distinctions between the performances of the two models. The pooled MLR model was then applied to the species sensitivity distribution to derive acute and chronic criteria equations similar in form to the USEPA's current hardness-based criteria equations but with DOC, pH, and hardness as the independent variables. Overall, the MLR is less responsive to DOC than the BLM across a range of hardness and pH conditions but more responsive to hardness than the BLM. Additionally, at low and intermediate hardness, the MLR model is less responsive than the BLM to pH, but the two models respond comparably at high hardness. The net effect of these different response profiles is that under many typical water quality conditions, MLR- and BLM-based criteria are quite comparable. Indeed, conditions where the two models differ most (high pH/low hardness and low pH/high hardness) are relatively rare in natural aquatic systems. We suggest that this MLR-based approach, which includes the mechanistic foundation of the BLM but is also consistent with widely accepted hardness-dependent WQC in terms of development and form, may facilitate adoption of updated state-wide Cu criteria that more accurately account for the parameters influencing Cu bioavailability than current hardness-based criteria.},

Chemical body burden and a suite of biological effects markers were measured in mussels positioned for 8 weeks at known distances from the discharge outlet. The biomarkers used included: condition index (CI); stress on stress (SoS); micronuclei formation (MN); acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibition, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and Neutral lipid (NL) accumulation. Methyl triethanol ammonium (MTA), a chemical marker for the esterquat based flotation chemical (FLOT2015), known to be used at the mine, was detected in mussels positioned 1500m and 2000m downstream from the discharge outlet. Overall the biological responses indicated an increased level of stress in mussels located closest to the discharge outlet. The same biomarkers (MN, SoS, NL) were responsible for the integrated biological response (IBR/n) of the two closest stations and indicates a response to a common point source. The integrated biological response index (IBR/n) reflected the expected level of exposure to the mine effluent, with the highest IBR/n calculated in mussels positioned closest to the discharge. Principal component analysis (PCA) also showed a clear separation between the mussel groups, with the most stressed mussels located closest to the mine tailing outlet. Although not one chemical factor could explain the increased stress on the mussels, highest metal (As, Co, Ni, Cd, Zn, Ag, Cu, Fe) and MTA concentrations were detected in the mussel group located closest to the mine discharge.

Concentrations of most elements (24 of 30) were higher (20-70\%) in cod compared to saithe. In particular, Hg was 6.8 times higher in cod than saithe. Nine elements were significantly different between FA saithe and control saithe, but only four (Hg, U, Cr and Mn) were highest in FA saithe, and this pattern was only detected consistently across all locations for Hg. Thirteen elements differed in concentration between FA cod and control cod, but only three elements (U, Al and Ba) were higher in FA cod than controls, and this pattern was only detected consistently across all locations for Al. After controlling for a set of potentially confounding variables, the estimated concentrations of Hg in saithe livers were similar to 80\% higher in FA fish compared to controls. In contrast, Hg concentrations were similar to 40\% higher in control cod compared to FA cod. Our results do not support the notion that salmon farms in general increase the concentrations of potentially harmful elements in wild fish, and the distribution of Hg and other elements in cod and saithe in Norwegian coastal waters may be more influenced by habitat use, diet, geochemical conditions and water chemistry.},

With the exception of Greenland, a large percentage of lakes showed enrichment factors for most elements well above 1.5, indicating atmospheric contamination. The influence of contamination has increased the co-distribution of trace elements in sediments, with the exception of As.Pb is the element that shows the highest contamination level at the European scale, followed by Hg and As. Zn, Cd, Cu and Se contamination is detectable to a lower degree.The Tatra Mountains and Scotland seem to be most affected. Natural mechanisms leading to the formation of highly organic, metal-binding sediments may be the cause of the high levels in Scotland, whereas those in the Tatras appear to be due to elevated deposition.The Retezat and Central Norway appear to be least polluted.In the Alps, enrichments in Pb, Hg and Zn are higher in southern than in central areas suggesting a flux of these pollutants from the south. In the Pyrenees, the high natural levels of As are remarkable. Metal enrichments in the Rila Mountains are comparable to those in the Tatras, but concentrations are much lower.In general terms, the increase in trace elements in modern with respect to pre-industrial sediments reflects the history of a long range contamination affecting the remotest locations in Europe.},

In this study, sediment samples from sites within the Pasvik River area with different histories of metal input were analyzed for metal contamination and occurrence of metal-resistant bacteria in late spring and summer of 2014. The major differences in microbial and chemical parameters were mostly dependent on local inputs than seasonality. Higher concentrations of metals were generally detected in July rather than May, with inner stations that became particularly enriched in Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn, but without significant differences. Bacterial resistance to metals, which resulted from viable counts on amended agar plates, was in the order Ni2+{$>$}Pb2+{$>$}Co2+{$>$}Zn2+{$>$}Cu2+{$>$}Cd2+{$>$}Hg2+, with higher values that were generally determined at inner stations. Among a total of 286 bacterial isolates (mainly achieved from Ni- and Pb-amended plates), the 7.2\% showed multiresistance at increasing metal concentration (up to 10,000ppm). Selected multiresistant isolates belonged to the genera Stenotrophomonas, Arthrobacter, and Serratia. Results highlighted that bacteria, rapidly responding to changing conditions, could be considered as true indicators of the harmful effect caused by contaminants on human health and environment and suggested their potential application in bioremediation processes of metal-polluted cold sites.},

Trophic transfer factors (TTFs) are analogous to bioaccumulation (accumulation) factors, the original terms used to describe steady-state tissue residues in an organism resulting from both water and dietary uptake pathways (Boroughs et al. 1957). TTFs are the same as biomagnification factors and also meet the definition of biomagnification when TTFs exceeding 1.0 are observed through three or more trophic levels as a result of at least two trophic transfers (Biddinger and Gloss 1984). Most investigators have assumed TTFs result mainly from dietary accumulation (Baptist and Lewis 1967; Mathews and Fisher 2008; Reinfelder et al. 1998), although it is not possible to distinguish aqueous from dietary uptake in field studies. Moreover, the relative importance of the diet and aqueous uptake pathways is context-dependent, varying with exposure duration, metal bioavailability, and the species and their prey. Application of the aquatic TTF concept, as currently understood, may have first been proposed by Baptist and Lewis (1967), and the term had been widely adopted by the early 1990s (Baudin and Nucho 1992; Dillon et al. 1995; Garnier-Laplace et al. 1997; Suedel et al. 1994).},

  abstract = {A major surface circulation feature of the Arctic Ocean is the Transpolar Drift (TPD), a current that transports river-influenced shelf water from the Laptev and East Siberian Seas toward the center of the basin and Fram Strait. In 2015, the international GEOTRACES program included a high-resolution pan-Arctic survey of carbon, nutrients, and a suite of trace elements and isotopes (TEIs). The cruises bisected the TPD at two locations in the central basin, which were defined by maxima in meteoric water and dissolved organic carbon concentrations that spanned 600 km horizontally and similar to 25-50 m vertically. Dissolved TEIs such as Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Hg, Nd, and Th, which are generally particle-reactive but can be complexed by organic matter, were observed at concentrations much higher than expected for the open ocean setting. Other trace element concentrations such as Al, V, Ga, and Pb were lower than expected due to scavenging over the productive East Siberian and Laptev shelf seas. Using a combination of radionuclide tracers and ice drift modeling, the transport rate for the core of the TPD was estimated at 0.9 +/- 0.4 Sv (10(6) m(3)s(-1)). This rate was used to derive the mass flux for TEIs that were enriched in the TPD, revealing the importance of lateral transport in supplying materials beneath the ice to the central Arctic Ocean and potentially to the North Atlantic Ocean via Fram Strait. Continued intensification of the Arctic hydrologic cycle and permafrost degradation will likely lead to an increase in the flux of TEIs into the Arctic Ocean.Plain Language Summary A major feature of the Arctic Ocean circulation is the Transpolar Drift (TPD), a surface current that carries ice and continental shelf-derived materials from Siberia across the North Pole to the North Atlantic Ocean. In 2015, an international team of oceanographers conducted a survey of trace elements in the Arctic Ocean, traversing the TPD. Near the North Pole, they observed much higher concentrations of trace elements in surface waters than in regions on either side of the current. These trace elements originated from land, and their journey across the Arctic Ocean is made possible by chemical reactions with dissolved organic matter that originates mainly in Arctic rivers. This study reveals the importance of rivers and shelf processes combined with strong ocean currents in supplying trace elements to the central Arctic Ocean and onward to the Atlantic. These trace element inputs are expected to increase as a result of permafrost thawing and increased river runoff in the Arctic, which is warming at a rate much faster than anywhere else on Earth. Since many of the trace elements are essential building blocks for ocean life, these processes could lead to significant changes in the marine ecosystems and fisheries of the Arctic Ocean.},

Despite the extensive literature available, discrimination between these two species remains challenging. Using genetically identified individuals, we simultaneously checked the morphological characters in use for C. glacialis and C. finmarchicus identification to compare the results of molecular and morphological identification. We studied the prosome length (1); the antennules and the genital somite pigmentation (2); the morphology of the fifth pair of swimming legs and of the mandible (3). Our results show that none of these morphological criteria can reliably distinguish between C. glacialis and C. finmarchicus.

As a consequence of global warming, metal concentrations in the Arctic region are increasing due to permafrost melting and changes in biological processes. Therefore, the fjord sediments were studied for identification of provenance, mobility, bioavailability, and potential toxicity of metals in the fjord environment. Finer sediments and organic matter were found to be higher away from the glacier outlets, while coarser sediments were found to be higher near the glacier head. Illite, kaolinite, and chlorite constituted the clay mineral assemblage which had slightly influenced the metal distributions. The variations in metal abundance were attributed largely to the glacial activity along with the influence of Atlantic water mass in western Spitsbergen. Fjord system received sediment from the weathering of rocks indicating an input of terrigenous material. Comparison of metals in bulk sediment with Arctic sediment quality guidelines (ASQGs) showed that Zn and Cu were enriched in the sediment. However, to avoid the overestimation of the risk associated, fractionation of the metals was carried out which revealed higher Mn and Co in labile phases that pose a considerable risk to the biota.},

The accumulation of sediments in lake basins and their distribution are affected by different mechanisms. Therefore, to understand the distribution of sediments, factors controlling the transport and metal enrichment in the lake environment, core~sediments were studied from four lakes (L-A, L-1, L-2 and L-3). Also, the potential ecological risk index (PERI) was computed to determine the impact of metal enrichment on the sediment-associated biota. The results obtained showed that the distribution of trace elements was mainly controlled by the major elements like Al, Ti, Fe, and Mn attributed to their lithogenic origin. Index of geoaccumulation (I(geo)) of all four lakes showed a moderate level of enrichment of metals like Cr and Cd indicating an enhanced supply of these metals probably from the catchment rocks and anthropogenic activities. A comparison of metals with Arctic Sediment Quality Guidelines (ASQGs) showed that Cd, Cr and Cu were enriched in the sediments of all the cores indicating the occurrence of adverse biological effects. Furthermore, a potential ecological risk index (PERI) revealed high Cd indicating considerable potential ecological risk to the sediment-associated biota. Thus, trace element influx to the lakes needs to be monitored with due emphasis on Cd contamination.},

The focus here is on the adjustment of this model to situations where a linear extrapolation of accumulated metals to increasing external metal exposures is not applicable. The amphipods tested accumulated metals upon exposure and it was possible to estimate significant model parameters of two-compartment models, with the sole exception of Zn. These could be used to predict accumulation of Cd, Cr and Ph in a concentration-dependent uptake study, for Cr directly and regarding simultaneous parameter estimation, for Cd and Pb after adjustment taking into account a non-linear relationship between bioconcentration factors (BCFs) and external metal exposures. The elements Cu and Ni need further evaluation, since linear predictions from the two-compartment models were not applicable, whilst a relationship between kinetic parameters and metal exposures could not be established. Kinetic BCFs at theoretical equilibrium were 80-202 for Cd, 80-112 for Cr, 306 for Cu, 251-520 for Ph and 23 for Ni. A tentative estimation showed the following sequence of sensitivity of G. oceanicus to an increase of soluble metal exposure: 0.6 mug Cd 1(-1), 0.8 mug Pb 1(-1), 2.5-2.9 mug Cr 1(-1), 8.5 mug Cu 1(-1) and 11 mug Ni 1(-1) . Available information can be used to quantify a measure of agreement or disagreement between bioaccumulation in different amphipods. This can be regarded as an important step in the calibration of biomonitors, which is necessary to assess the potential for bioaccumulation on a large geographical scale. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Chemical contamination from point source discharges in developed (resource-rich) countries has been widely regulated and studied for decades; however, diffuse sources are largely unregulated and widespread. In the European Union (EU), large dischargers report releases of some chemicals, yet little is known of total emissions (point and diffuse) and their relative significance. We estimated copper loadings from all significant sources including industry, sewage treatment plants, surface runoff (from traffic, architecture, and atmospheric deposition), septic tanks, agriculture, mariculture, marine transport (antifoulant leaching), and natural processes. A combination of European datasets, literature, and industry data were used to generate export coefficients. These were then multiplied by activity rates to derive loads. A total of approximately 8 kt of copper per annum (ktpa) is estimated to enter freshwaters in the EU, and another 3.5 ktpa enters transitional and coastal waters. The main inputs to freshwater are natural processes (3.7 ktpa), agriculture (1.8 ktpa), and runoff (1.8 ktpa). Agricultural emissions are dominated by copper-based plant protection products and farmyard manure. Urban runoff is influenced by copper use in architecture and by vehicle brake linings. Antifoulant leaching from boats (3.2 ktpa) dominates saline water loads of copper. It is noteworthy that most of the emissions originate in a limited number of copper uses where environmental exposure and pathways exist, compared with the bulk of copper use within electrical and electronic equipment and infrastructure that has no environmental pathway during its use. A sensitivity analysis indicated significant uncertainty in data from abandoned mines and urban runoff load estimates. This study provided for the first time a methodology and comprehensive metal load apportionment to European aquatic systems, identifying data gaps and uncertainties, which may be refined over time. Source apportionments using this methodology can inform more cost-effective environmental risk assessment and management. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2023;19:1031--1047.  2022 The Authors.

The concentrations of metals in starfish from natural populations along the gradient (long-term accumulation) and in starfish that were transferred up the gradient (short-term accumulation) were compared. At long-term, Cd and Pb accumulations by starfish living at normal salinity (30parts per thousand) were related to the level of contamination of the environment while Cu and, to a lesser extent, Zn accumulations appeared strictly controlled. At short-term, Pb was accumulated steadily, Cd and Zn were accumulated transiently in the pyloric caeca (fast compartment), and Cu was not accumulated at all. Depuration experiments (transfer down the gradient) showed that Cd and Pb were efficiently eliminated from the pyloric caeca but not from the body wall (slow compartment). It is concluded that Pb is chronically accumulated, without apparent control, Cd is subjected to a regulating mechanism in the pyloric. caeca which is overwhelmed over the long-term; Zn is tightly controlled in the pyloric caeca and Cu in both pyloric caeca and body wall. A distinct color variety of starfish is restricted to the low salinity (22-26parts per thousand) superficial water layer. This variety showed a different pattern of metal accumulation over the long-term. This pattern is attributed to the particular hydrological conditions prevailing in this upper layer.},

  abstract = {Copper (Cu) has sparked widespread global concern as one of the most hazardous metals to aquatic animals. Ocean acidification (OA) and warming (OW) are expected to alter copper's bioavailability based on pH and temperature-sensitive effects; research on their effects on copper on marine organisms is still in its infancy. Therefore, under representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, we used the multiple linear regression-water quality criteria (MLR-WQC) method to assess the effects of OA and OW on the ecological risk posed by copper in the Ocean of East China (OEC), which includes the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea. The results showed that there was a positive correlation between temperature and copper toxicity, while there was a negative correlation between pH and copper toxicity. The short-term water quality criteria (WQC) values were 1.53, 1.41, 1.30 and 1.13~{$\mu$}g{$\cdot$}L-1, while the long-term WQC values were 0.58, 0.48, 0.40 and 0.29~{$\mu$}g{$\cdot$}L-1 for 2020, 2099-RCP2.6, 2099-RCP4.5 and 2099-RCP8.5, respectively. Cu in the OEC poses a moderate ecological risk. Under the current copper exposure situation, strict intervention (RCP2.6) only increases the ecological risk of copper exposure by 20~\%, and no intervention (RCP8.5) will increase the ecological risk of copper exposure by nearly double. The results indicate that intervention on carbon emissions can slow down the rate at which OA and OW worsen the damage copper poses to marine creatures. This study can provide valuable information for a comprehensive understanding of the combined impacts of climate change and copper on marine organisms.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the ecological hazards associated with copper, which has sparked increased interest in copper water quality criteria (WQC). The crucial factors affecting the bioavailability of copper in seawater are now acknowledged to be salinity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pH, and temperature. Research on the influence of these four water quality parameters on copper toxicity is rapidly expanding. However, a comprehensive and clear understanding of the relevant mechanisms is currently lacking, hindering the development of a consistent international method to establish the seawater WQC value for copper. As a response to this knowledge gap, this study presents a comprehensive summary with two key focuses: (1) It meticulously analyzes the effects of salinity, DOC, pH, and temperature on copper toxicity to marine organisms. It takes into account the adaptability of different species to salinity, pH and temperature. (2) Additionally, the study delves into the impact of these four water parameters on the acute toxicity values of copper on marine organisms while also reviewing the methods used in establishing the marine WQC value of copper. The study proposed a two-step process: initially zoning based on the difference of salinity and DOC, followed by the establishment of Cu WQC values for different zones during various seasons, considering the impacts of water quality parameters on copper toxicity. By providing fundamental scientific insights, this research not only enhances our understanding and predictive capabilities concerning water quality parameter-dependent Cu toxicity in marine organisms but also contributes to the development of copper seawater WQC values. Ultimately, this valuable information facilitates more informed decision-making in marine water quality management efforts.},

A chemical and histological study was conducted on fourhorn and shorthorn sculpins collected around a contaminated lead-zinc mine at East Greenland to investigate whether there were any differences in the residues of metals, histopathology and parasites in liver and gills between the two sculpin species. The results demonstrated that concentrations of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) were significantly higher in the fourhorn sculpins (p {$<$} 0.001) while there were no significant differences for arsenic (As) or cadmium (Cd). Furthermore, density of blood vessel fibrosis (p=0.028), prevalence and density of chondroplasia (p=0.002 and p=0.005, respectively), number of mucin-containing mucous cells (p {$<$} 0.001) and chloride cells (p {$<$} 0.001) and mean intensity of colonial Peritricha (p {$<$} 0.001) were significantly higher in fourhorn sculpin.

The common features and dissimilarities in the origin and nature of street dust were investigated through a series of studies in two widely different cities, Madrid (Spain) and Oslo (Norway), between 1990 and 1994. The most comprehensive sampling campaign was carried out in the Norwegian capital during the summer of 1994. An area of 14 km(2), covering most of downtown Oslo and some residential districts to the north of the city, was divided into 1 km(2) mapping units, and 16 sampling increments of approximately 150 g were collected from streets and roads in each of them. The fraction below 100 mu m was acid-digested and analysed by ICP-MS. Statistical analyses of the results suggest that chemical elements in street dust can be classified into three groups: ''urban'' elements (Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Mg, Pb, Sb, Ti, Zn), ''natural'' elements (Al, Ga, La, Mn, Na, Sr, Th, Y) and elements of a mixed origin or which have undergone geochemical changes from their original sources (Ca, Cs, Fe, Mo, Ni, Rb, Sr, U). Soil resuspension and/or mobilisation appears to be the most important source of ''natural'' elements, while ''urban'' elements originate primarily from traffic and from the weathering and corrosion of building materials. The data for Pb seem to prove that the gradual shift from leaded to unleaded petrol as fuel for automobiles has resulted in an almost proportional reduction in the concentration of Pb in dust particles under 100 mu m. This fact and the spatial distribution of Pb in the city strongly suggest that lead sources other than traffic (i.e. lead accumulated in urban soil over the years) may contribute as much lead, if not more, to urban street dust.

Measures taken to protect the environment based on exposure data can have social and economic implications. Flawed information may lead to measures being taken in the wrong place or to important action not being taken. Although the advantages of harmonizing evaluation methods have been demonstrated for hazard information, no comparable approach is established for exposure data evaluation. The goal of Criteria for Reporting and Evaluating Exposure Datasets (CREED) is to improve the transparency and consistency with which exposure data are evaluated regarding usability in environmental assessments. Here, we describe the synthesis of the CREED process, and propose methods and tools to summarize and interpret the outcomes of the data usability evaluation in support of decision-making and communication. The CREED outcome includes a summary that reports any key gaps or shortcomings in the reliability (data quality) and relevance (fitness for purpose) of the data being considered. The approach has been implemented in a workbook template (provided as Supporting Information), for assessors to readily follow the workflow and create a report card for any given dataset. The report card communicates the outcome of the CREED evaluation and summarizes important dataset attributes, providing a concise reference pertaining to the dataset usability for a specified purpose and documenting data limitations that may restrict data use or increase environmental assessment uncertainty. The application of CREED is demonstrated through three case studies, which also were used during beta testing of the methodology. As experience with the CREED approach application develops, further improvements may be identified and incorporated into the framework. Such development is to be encouraged in the interest of better science and decision-making, and to make environmental monitoring and assessment more cost-effective.

Multiple linear regressions indicated region was a significant factor influencing Al, Zn, Se and Hg feather concentrations. Blood Cd and Hg concentrations were significantly influenced by agricultural land cover. Urbanization did not have a significant impact on trace element concentrations in either blood or feathers. Overall metal and trace element levels do not indicate a high risk for toxic effects in the nestlings. Levels of Cd in Troms{\o} and Hg in Trondheim were however above sub-lethal toxic threshold levels.

  abstract = {The number of anthropogenic chemicals, manufactured, by-products, metabolites and abiotically formed transformation products, counts to hundreds of thousands, at present. Thus, humans and wildlife are exposed to complex mixtures, never one chemical at a time and rarely with only one dominating effect. Hence there is an urgent need to develop strategies on how exposure to multiple hazardous chemicals and the combination of their effects can be assessed. A workshop, ``Advancing the Assessment of Chemical Mixtures and their Risks for Human Health and the Environment'' was organized in May 2018 together with Joint Research Center in Ispra, EU-funded research projects and Commission Services and relevant EU agencies. This forum for researchers and policy-makers was created to discuss and identify gaps in risk assessment and governance of chemical mixtures as well as to discuss state of the art science and future research needs. Based on the presentations and discussions at this workshop we want to bring forward the following Key Messages:{$\bullet$}We are at a turning point: multiple exposures and their combined effects require better management to protect public health and the environment from hazardous chemical mixtures.{$\bullet$}Regulatory initiatives should be launched to investigate the opportunities for all relevant regulatory frameworks to include prospective mixture risk assessment and consider combined exposures to (real-life) chemical mixtures to humans and wildlife, across sectors.{$\bullet$}Precautionary approaches and intermediate measures (e.g. Mixture Assessment Factor) can already be applied, although, definitive mixture risk assessments cannot be routinely conducted due to significant knowledge and data gaps.{$\bullet$}A European strategy needs to be set, through stakeholder engagement, for the governance of combined exposure to multiple chemicals and mixtures. The strategy would include research aimed at scientific advancement in mechanistic understanding and modelling techniques, as well as research to address regulatory and policy needs. Without such a clear strategy, specific objectives and common priorities, research, and policies to address mixtures will likely remain scattered and insufficient.},

  abstract = {Photodegradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is highly important in humic waters of peatland regions, yet the coupling between organic and organo-mineral colloids, trace metals and bioavailability of photodegraded products is poorly known. Here we studied photo-destruction of organo-mineral colloids induced by UV-irradiation of sterile-filtered mire water. We revealed two simultaneously occurring processes of transformation of DOM and trace elements speciation: (i) disintegration of high molecular weight organo-mineral colloids into lower molecular weight ({$<$}1~kDa) DOM and metal complexes and (ii) formation of particulate ({$>$}0.22~{$\mu$}m) aggregates of metals and organic matter. Over 26 days of UV-irradiation, up to 20\% of dissolved organic carbon from peat waters was transformed into CO(2). In addition to transformation of organic compounds, sizeable change in speciation and size fractionation of many trace metals such as Fe, Pb, Cd, Co, Zn, Cu, V, La, Ni and Cr occurred. Although short-term (1 day) UV-irradiation of mire water stimulated growth of cultivable Pseudomonas sp. bacterium, the long-term exposure (26 days) of organic substrate had a negative effect on bacterial development. Therefore, while sizeable transformation of the organic and metal colloidal load of peat water may occur over first 10 days of UV-irradiation, the enhanced bioavailability of UV-treated substrate is achieved after first day of exposure. The present study demonstrates the importance of even short-term UV-irradiation on colloidal transformation and potential bioavailability of humic waters from temperate mires and highlights the need for more detailed study of coupled metal-organic matter transformation induced by sunlight exposure of mire waters.},

Fiord sediments near the former Black Angel Mine in West Greenland are contaminated by lead and zinc as a result of submarine tailings disposal in 1973-1990. In 1999 cores were taken up to 10 km away from the disposal area. Analyses include heavy metals, radiochemical dating (Pb-210) and high-resolution foraminiferal stratigraphy. The mining operation resulted in significant changes in the assemblage composition. In addition, up to 20\% of the Melonis barleeanus population found in sediment deposited during nearby tailings disposal was deformed compared to a natural background of less than 5\%. Throughout cores representing the last 100 years of sedimentation, the total numbers and frequency of morphological abnormalities among M. barleeanus revealed some correlation with heavy metals concentrations (up to r(2) = 79\%).

Microplastics subjected to the marine environment were collected on beaches (Guadeloupe) exposed to the north Atlantic gyre. We established a strategy to discriminate sorbed contaminants from additives based on the metal concentration profiles in MP subsurface using qualitative and quantitative approaches. A spatiotemporal correlation of the sorption pattern was proposed to compare MPs in terms of relative exposure time and time-weighted average concentrations in the exposure media.},

The current study combines monitoring and modelling approaches to investigate concentrations, influent patterns, size distribution and removal of 20 elements for the two primary WWTPs (Ladehammeren, LARA; H{\o}vringen, H{\O}RA) serving Trondheim, the third largest city in Norway. Element concentrations were determined in raw influent wastewater, effluents and biosolids, and diurnal inflow patterns were assessed. The elemental distribution in particulate, colloidal and dissolved fractions of untreated wastewater was characterized using filtration separation and electron microscopy. An influent generator model and multivariate statistical analyses were used to determine release patterns and to predict the (co-)occurrence of selected elements. Raw influent wastewater concentrations for most elements were similar in the two WWTPs, with only Ca, Mn, Fe, Co and Ba being significantly higher (p~{$<~$}0.05) in H{\O}RA (which receives more household and hospital discharges). Removal efficiencies varied between elements, but in most cases reflected their association with particulates. Nanosized particles of several elements were detected, with Cu/Zn being most common. Measured concentrations of most elements followed typical diurnal wastewater discharge patterns and enrichment factors calculated for biosolids confirmed the importance of anthropogenic sources for P, Cu, Zn, Cd, As, Cr, Ni, Pb, V, Co and Fe. Elemental concentrations generally correlated well with total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations at H{\O}RA, while this was less pronounced in LARA (possibly due to higher industrial contributions). In one of its first applications for WWTP influent pattern examination, principal component analysis was found to be instrumental for source identification of target elements, showing significant differences between LARA and H{\O}RA influents. The combined experimental, statistical and modelling approaches used herein allowed for improved understanding of element sources, patterns of discharge and fate in primary WWTPs.},

The present review describes 4 ecotoxicological AOP case studies, developed for different purposes.

Some general strategies can be gleaned from these case studies, which a developer may find to be useful for supporting an existing AOP or creating a new one.

Although the algal growth rate in sea water was halved by 20 {$\mu$}g Cu{$\cdot$}1-1, photosynthesis was not affected until the copper concentration was above 100 {$\mu$}g Cu{$\cdot$}1-1. This decoupling of growth and photosynthesis did not occur to the same extent with other algae species tested, and it is proposed that it results from an intracellular reaction between Cu2+ and GSH, leading to a lowering of the GSH/GSSG ratio and suppression of mitosis. Water-soluble ligands generally decreased the toxicity of copper, whereas lipid-soluble copper complexes were highly toxic. Oxine, 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, and pyridyl- and thiazolyl-hydroxyazo compounds formed exceptionally toxic complexes. The toxicity of many redox-active compounds and their copper complexes appears to be due, at least partly, to the intracellular generation of hydrogen peroxide during oxidation of these compounds, an effect exacerbated by the ability of copper to inhibit catalase. Hydrogen peroxide is highly toxic towards marine algae, and may be a natural growth-inhibiting factor. Hydroxyl radicals (OH{$\cdot$}), generated intracellularly from a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and the lipid-soluble thiol, cysteine, were also extremely toxic. However, when OH{$\cdot$} or superoxide radicals O2sce; were generated extracellularly, no effect on growht rate was observed, even though singlet oxygen (1O2) did seriously reduce growth.},

RESULTS: Among the trace elements analysed, only Cd, with an oceanic specific food origin, was found to be useful as an ecological tracer. All other trace elements studied were not useful, most likely because of physiological regulation and/or few specific sources in the food web. The delta13C, delta15N signatures and Cd levels were highly correlated with each other, as well as with local bathymetry and geographic position (latitude). Variation in the isotopic ratios indicated a shift in harbour porpoise's feeding habits from pelagic prey species in deep northern waters to more coastal and/or demersal prey in the relatively shallow North Sea and Skagerrak waters. This result is consistent with stomach content analyses found in the literature. This shift was associated with a northward Cd-enrichment which provides further support to the Cd 'anomaly' previously reported in polar waters and suggests that porpoises in deep northern waters include Cd-contaminated prey in their diet, such as oceanic cephalopods. CONCLUSION: As stable isotopes and Cd provide information in the medium and the long term respectively, the spatial variation found, shows that harbour porpoises experience different ecological regimes during the year along the Scandinavian coasts, adapting their feeding habits to local oceanographic conditions, without performing extensive migration.},

The variation in the leaching of heavy metals from tailings was investigated by a small-scale batch leaching experiment. Results showed that 10~{$^\circ$}C is a threshold temperature for the leaching activity of the tested elements. Fe, Cr, and Cu are significantly correlated with temperature in the leaching. Leaching rates of Cr, Cu, and Ni increase as temperature rises. Leaching rates of Cr, Cu, Ni, V, and Zn change by a polynomial model with temperatures, whereas that of Fe changes with a linear model. V shows an antagonistic relationship with Cu, Fe, and Ni in the leaching. However, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Fe show a synergistic relationship.

  abstract = {Arctic autochthonous communities and the environment face unprecedented challenges due to climate change and anthropogenic activities. One less-explored aspect of these challenges is the release and distribution of anthropogenic nanomaterials in autochthonous communities. This study pioneers a comprehensive investigation into the nature and dispersion of anthropogenic nanomaterials within Arctic Autochthonous communities, originating from their traditional waste-burning practices. Employing advanced nanoanalytical tools, we unraveled the nature and prevalence of nanomaterials, including metal oxides (TiO2, PbO), alloys (SnPb, SbPb, SnAg, SnCu, SnZn), chromated copper arsenate-related nanomaterials (CuCrO2, CuCr2O4), and nanoplastics (polystyrene and polypropylene) in snow and sediment near waste burning sites. This groundbreaking study illuminates the unintended consequences of waste burning in remote Arctic areas, stressing the urgent need for interdisciplinary research, community engagement, and sustainable waste management. These measures are crucial to safeguard the fragile Arctic ecosystem and the health of autochthonous communities.},

Four sampling sites that encompass a wide range of sediment metal loads were compared in a Norwegian fjord (Sorfjord). HCI-extractable metals and organic matter constantly decreased from the most contaminated site (SI) to the control site (S4). All sampling sites presented low polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations (Sigma(7)PCB {$<$} 7.0 ng g [dry weight](-1)) The biomass ranged from 4.3 X 10(8) to 13.4 X 10(8) cells g (dry weight) of sediments(-1) and was not correlated to metal levels. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis indicated that diversity was not affected by the contamination. The majority of the partial 16S rRNA sequences obtained were classified in the gamma- and delta-Proteobacteria and in the C,tophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides (CFB) bacteria. Some sequences were closely related to other sequences from polluted marine sediments. The abundances of seven phylogenetic groups were determined by using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). FISH was impaired in S1 by high levels of autofluorescing particles. For S2 to S4, the results indicated that the HCI-extractable Cu, Pb, and Zn were negatively correlated with the abundance of gamma-Proteobacteria and CFB bacteria. delta-Proteobacteria were not correlated with 110-extractable metals. Bacteria of the Desuffiosarcina-Desulfococcus group were detected in every site and represented 6 to 14\% of the DAPI (4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole) counts. Although factors other than metals may explain the distribution observed, the information presented here may be useful in predicting long-term effects of heavy-metal contamination in the marine environment.},

  abstract = {Due to their small size, nanoplastics (NPLs) possess specific properties which can potentiate their toxicity towards aquatic organisms. As primary producers, microalgae are at the base of aquatic food chains, thus negative impacts of NPLs will likely lead to disturbances in ecosystem productivity. The majority of data available on the toxicity of NPLs is limited to polystyrene and green microalgae, leaving a significant lack of knowledge on impacts of other polymer types across different taxonomic groups. So, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the cell responses of the red microalgae Rhodomonas baltica to plain and carboxylated poly(methyl methacrylate) NPLs (PMMA and PMMA-COOH, 50~nm). Results showed different NPL behaviour in media over time, with PMMA forming micro-scale aggregates and PMMA-COOH maintaining its nominal size range. PMMA caused a higher impact in cellular and physiological parameters than PMMA-COOH, even though a decrease in algal growth was only seen for the later. Overall, PMMA caused a significant decrease in cell viability followed by an increase in cell size and complexity, overproduction of pigments, loss of membrane integrity, hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, increased production of ROS and LPO, decrease in DNA content and reduced photosynthetic capacity. Conversely, a decrease in algal growth for PMMA-COOH was connected to an impairment in cell cycle and consequent decrease in cell viability, metabolic activity and photosynthetic performance, with negligible effects in ROS formation and pigments content. This study provided a first insight into the mechanistic understanding of the toxic impacts of PMMA and PMMA-COOH NPLs in red microalgae. Results obtained suggest an interaction between both NPLs and R. baltica cell surface that is dependent on particle behaviour and surface chemistry. Future experiments focusing on the in-depth characterization of the mode of action of these particles are recommended.},

  abstract = {The fate of heavy metals and nutrients melting out of the cryosphere into aquatic systems is not well understood. To address this, we measured heavy metals and nutrients in the water and sediment of four glacially-fed (GF) and four snow and groundwater-fed (SF) lakes near Kangerlussuaq, West Greenland during the summer of 2023. Average nutrient concentrations - total phosphorus (TP), NO(3)(-), and NH(4)(+)~-~in the water of GF lakes were 86~\% higher and average total concentrations of some metals - Cd, Pb, Cr, Co, Ni, Al, Fe, Cu, Zn - were 137~\% higher compared to nearby SF lakes. This pattern was also reflected in the sediment, where metal concentrations were generally higher in GF lakes compared to SF lakes. However, a few metals, including Hg, As, Cu, and Pb, were higher in SF compared to GF sediment. Our results suggest metals may be increasing over the past few years to decades in GF lakes, and certain metals have increased in SF lakes, notably Hg has substantially increased (298~\%), as well as Pb (52.8~\%), in SF lakes over the past century. The increase in Hg and Pb in SF, but not GF lakes, is likely due to the higher organic carbon and longer residence times of SF compared to GF lakes. In one GF lake, we quantified inputs and outputs of metals and nutrients, and we found that loads declined by an average of 71~\% for metals and 68~\% for nutrients from the lake inlet to outlet, suggesting the lake is a sink for these materials. SF lakes also appear to be reservoirs of some metals, specifically atmospherically deposited metals (Hg, Pb, As, and Cu). Our results highlight that GF lakes in West Greenland are elevated in nutrients and some metals compared to nearby SF lakes, indicating that the source of these materials is likely meltwater from the glacial system. We found that GF lakes can sequester a high percentage of the nutrients and metals flowing into them; however, as meltwater fluxes increase due to climate change, the ability of these lakes to remain sinks is an open question.},

Vital mitigation measures against aquatic contamination from road runoff include the use of sedimentation ponds. However, it has been demonstrated that ecosystems in sedimentation ponds might be affected by road runoff. Sediments from six natural ponds and 27 sedimentation ponds were investigated to determine the environmental risk of contaminants. The amount of traffic on the respective roads associated with the sedimentation ponds was correlated with the environmental concentrations. Quantification included seven metals, the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkylated PACs, dibenzothiophene, benzo[e]pyrene, and perylene. The environmental risk was assessed according to the European Union Water Framework Directive guidelines. Sedimentation ponds had a higher level of contaminants than natural ponds, and environmental risks were dominated by the concentration of PACs. Alkylated PACs contributed to the environmental risk posed by PACs and should be included in future monitoring. Only Cu and Zn were measured at concentrations above the environmental quality standards (EQSs), while 13 PACs exceeded the EQS. Sediment concentrations of Cu, Zn, and most PACs correlated significantly with the amount of traffic. The sources of PACs were determined by source apportionment ratios between PACs. Alkylation and pyrogenic indices showed that sources in natural ponds were of mostly pyrogenic origin, whereas in sedimentation ponds they were predominantly petrogenic. Asphalt was the probable main source of PACs. A hierarchical clustering technique was used to investigate both the environmental risks and the pattern of PACs in the ponds and revealed that a few sedimentation ponds were not protecting the environment as intended because the upper sediment layers had not been regularly dredged.

The metal size distribution in the rivers was compared to pH, Ca concentration, alkalinity, conductivity, and total organic carbon (TOC). Data plots based on the present and other studies also yielded information about the interrelations between TOC, pH and metal adsorption in rivers and lakes.

In three pH neutral rivers, on average 55\% of Al was in colloidal form, whereas the dissolved and particulate fractions were 21\% and 23\%, respectively. Our data combined with data from similar studies support conclusions from other research suggesting that the percent fraction of metals adsorbed on particles rises steeply from almost zero to nearly 100\% within a narrow and element specific pH range.

The aim is to provide new data on soils in the Arctic and to gain more knowledge about the role of the soil in the biogeochemical cycle of mercury (Hg). Concentrations are reported for Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, S and Zn. Samples were taken in Adventdalen and in the area near Ny-{\AA}lesund. We obtained a mean Hg concentration of 0.111~{\textpm}~0.036~{$\mu$}g/g in surface soils (range 0.041-0.254~{$\mu$}g/g). Hg levels in mineral soils (mean: 0.025~{\textpm}~0.013~{$\mu$}g/g; range: 0.004-0.060~{$\mu$}g/g) were substantially lower than in the corresponding surface soils. Hg strongly accumulates in the surface soil layer (upper 3~cm) and is associated with SOM (surface soil: 59~{\textpm}~14\%). Hg concentrations in the surface soil were slightly lower than those in the humus layer in mainland Norway and were comparable to levels in soils elsewhere in the Arctic. An inverse association of Hg was found with elements attributed to the mineral soil, indicating that Hg is predominantly derived from atmospheric deposition.},

  abstract = {Crumb rubber granulate (CRG) produced from end of life tires (ELTs) is commonly applied to synthetic turf pitches (STPs), playgrounds, safety surfaces and walkways. In addition to fillers, stabilizers, cross-linking agents and secondary components (e.g., pigments, oils, resins), ELTs contain a range of other organic compound and heavy metal additives. While previous environmental impact studies on CRG have focused on terrestrial soil and freshwater ecosystems, many sites applying CRG in Norway are coastal. The current study investigated the organic chemical and metal additive content of 'pristine' and 'weathered' CRG and their seawater leachates, as well as uptake and effects of leachate exposure using marine copepods (AcartiaandCalanussp.). A combination of pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (py-GC-MS) and chemical extraction followed by GC-MS analysis revealed similar organic chemical profiles for pristine and weathered CRG, including additives such as benzothiazole,N-1,3-dimethylbutyl-N '-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine and a range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and phenolic compounds (e.g., bisphenols). ICP-MS analysis revealed g kg(-1) quantities of Zn and mg kg(-1)quantities of Fe, Mn, Cu, Co, Cr, Pb, and Ni in the CRG. A cocktail of organic additives and metals readily leached from the CRG into seawater, with the most abundant leachate components being benzothiazole and Zn, Fe, Co (metals), as well as detectable levels of PAHs and phenolic compounds. Concentrations of individual components varied with CRG source material and CRG to seawater ratio, but benzothiazole and Zn were typically the organic and metal components present at the highest concentrations in the leachates. While organic chemical concentrations in the leachates stabilized within days, metals continued to leach out over the 30-day period. Marine copepods exposed to high CRG leachate concentrations exhibited high mortalities within 48 h. The smaller lipid-poorAcartiahad a higher sensitivity to leachates than the larger lipid-richCalanus, indicating species-specific differences in vulnerability to leachates. The effect on survival was alleviated at lower leachate concentrations, indicating a dose-response relationship. Benzothiazole and its derivatives appear to be of concern owing to their proven toxicity, while bisphenols are also known to be toxic and were enriched in the leachates relative to the other compounds in the CRG.},

  abstract = {This mini-review outlines major climate-change exacerbated sources of metal to the Arctic marine environment, leading to measured concentrations sometimes exceeding levels considered environmentally safe, and thus potentially impacting arctic marine zooplankton. We review the bioavailability of metals in Arctic marine environments and the current state of knowledge on metal toxicity in marine copepods. Toxicity response mechanisms to metals included oxidative stress as well as genetic processes of DNA damage and repair. We highlight species-specific differences in metal impacts within the diverse group of planktonic copepods. We summarize observed responses at multiple levels of biological organization, and note that studies on arctic species are scarce and need expansion, as results from temperate and tropical species may not be readily transferable to arctic counterparts. We further provide an updated view on impacts of metals in combination with other stressors in the Arctic marine system in light of increasing attention to multiple stressors of climate change and pollution. For arctic marine zooplankton, a number of research gaps are identified, including a need for integrating effects responses across levels of biological organization, for studies into mechanisms of heritable changes and long-term transgenerational impacts, and considering interspecific capacity for response and adaptation.},

  abstract = {Three populations of brown trout (Salmo trutta) exposed to different metal levels in their natural environments, were studied with respect to antioxidants metallothionein (MT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) as well as for corresponding mRNA levels. In addition, mRNA levels were studied for glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR). The Cd/Zn-exposed trout (Naustebekken River) had higher accumulated levels of Cd, Cu and Zn in gills, and higher levels of MT (both protein and mRNA) in liver and kidney as well as in gills compared to the Cu-exposed trout (Rugla River) and trout from an uncontaminated reference river (Stribekken River). Less MT found in the Cu-exposed trout may increase susceptibility to oxidative stress, but no higher levels of antioxidant mRNAs were found in gills of these trouts. The data indicated that chronic exposures of brown trout to Cd, Zn and/or Cu did not involve maintenance of high activities of SOD and CAT enzymes in gills, although SOD mRNA levels were higher in the Cd/Zn-exposed trout. In livers, mRNA levels of SOD, CAT and GPx were higher in the metal-exposed trout, but in the case of GR this was only seen in kidneys of Cd/Zn-exposed trout. However, both metal-exposed groups had higher activities of SOD enzyme in liver compared to the unexposed reference trout, and CAT activity was found to be higher in kidneys of Cu-exposed trout. The Cu-exposed trout did not seem to rely on MT production to avoid Cu toxicity in gills, but rather by keeping the Cu uptake at a low level. A coordinated expression of different stress genes may also be important in chronic metal exposure. It may be concluded that the observed metal effects relies on acclimation rather than on genetic adaptation in the metal exposed populations.},

In addition to metallothionein (MT-A), Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) gene transcription, protein levels of MT and enzyme activities of SOD and CAT were analyzed in gill, liver and kidney. MT-A, SOD and GR transcription increased significantly along with uptake of Cu in gills, while only transcription of MT-A was found to respond in liver and kidney during the exposure. Already present MT proteins in gills seemed to be oxidized during the exposure, probably caused by Cu-mediated oxidative stress, and no increase in MT protein levels were observed in gills. SOD and CAT enzyme levels were affected in all tissues during the exposure. A negative correlation between SOD and CAT activities was observed in gills, and we suggest that the activities of these enzymes were influenced not only through transcription. GPx and GR transcription levels correlated positively with each other in gills and liver, indicating their shared function in GSH-turnover. Levels of MT and activity of SOD and CAT dealing with metal-induced oxidative stress appear to be regulated not only through gene transcription, but also through post-translational mechanisms.},

Trout from a river with low levels of metals (the Stribekken River) was transferred to a river with high levels of Cd and Zn (the Naustebekken River) and exposed up to 15 days. The aim of this transfer experiment was to investigate how exposure to Cd and Zn induced transcription and activities of central antioxidant enzymes and proteins in an environmental setting. Significant uptake of both Cd and Zn was observed in gills during the 15 days exposure, and Cd levels was found to correlate significantly with transcript levels of MT-A, SOD, GPx and GR. Gill concentrations of Zn did not correlate significantly with the transcript levels of the stress genes studied, but Zn might have triggered transcription of proteins which dealt with subsequent accumulation of Cd. SOD and CAT activities increased in gills after transfer, but MT protein levels decreased. In liver, SOD activity and MT protein levels increased, while in kidney only MT protein concentrations were elevated after transfer. There was a general lack of consistency between mRNA transcription and enzyme activities, indicating that these proteins and enzymes are not solely under transcriptional control.},

  abstract = {Oil and gas industries in the Northern Atlantic Ocean have gradually moved closer to the Arctic areas, a process expected to be further facilitated by sea ice withdrawal caused by global warming. Copepods of the genus Calanus hold a key position in these cold-water food webs, providing an important energetic link between primary production and higher trophic levels. Due to their ecological importance, there is a concern about how accidental oil spills and produced water discharges may impact cold-water copepods. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the toxicity of petroleum on North Atlantic and Arctic Calanus copepods. We also review how recent development of high-quality transcriptomes from RNA-sequencing of copepods have identified genes regulating key biological processes, like molting, diapause and reproduction in Calanus copepods, to suggest linkages between exposure, molecular mechanisms and effects on higher levels of biological organization. We found that the available ecotoxicity threshold data for these copepods provide valuable information about their sensitivity to acute petrogenic exposures; however, there is still insufficient knowledge regarding underlying mechanisms of toxicity and the potential for long-term implications of relevance for copepod ecology and phenology. Copepod transcriptomics has expanded our understanding of how key biological processes are regulated in cold-water copepods. These advances can improve our understanding of how pollutants affect biological processes, and thus provide the basis for new knowledge frameworks spanning the effect continuum from molecular initiating events to adverse effects of regulatory relevance. Such efforts, guided by concepts such as adverse outcome pathways (AOPs), enable standardized and transparent characterization and evaluation of knowledge and identifies research gaps and priorities. This review suggests enhancing mechanistic understanding of exposure-effect relationships to better understand and link biomarker responses to adverse effects to improve risk assessments assessing ecological effects of pollutant mixtures, like crude oil, in Arctic areas.},

This experiment was conducted to gain information about the underlying resistance mechanisms developed in fish exposed to metal environments. The focus was on gill metal accumulation and transcription of the metal-responsive stress genes metallothionein-A (MT-A), Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and heat shock protein 70 (HSP-70). The only shared response shown between the three groups after transfer were Cu accumulation and MT-A induction. The Cu-acclimated trout produced mucus to reduce the uptake of Cu into the gills. The MT-A levels were highest in the Cd/Zn-acclimated trout both before and after transfer. Before transfer, antioxidant transcription (SOD and GPx) was higher in gills of Cu-acclimated compared to the Cd/Zn-acclimated trout, but increased transcription of antioxidant stress genes was observed after transfer in both metal-acclimated groups. The metal-acclimated trout groups also showed an increase in the transcription of HSP-70. Compared to the reference population not previously exposed to metals, stress gene transcription increased faster in the metal-acclimated populations. The exception was induction of CAT, which appeared to be depressed after transfer in Cd/Zn-acclimated trout. The data indicate that acclimation to chronic metal exposure involves different strategies to cope with different metals and that these strategies involve both physiological mechanisms (mucus production) as well as metal-related stress gene transcription.},

The aim of this study was to assess Ni, Cu, Co, As, Pb, Cd, and Hg concentrations in local wild foods from these border regions. During 2013--2014, we collected samples of different berry, mushroom, fish, and game species from sites at varying distances from the Ni-Cu smelter in all three border regions. Our results indicate that the Ni-Cu smelter is the main source of Ni, Co, and As in local wild foods, whereas the sources of Pb and Cd are more complex. We observed no consistent trends for Cu, one of the main toxic elements emitted by the Ni-Cu smelter; nor did we find any trend for Hg in wild food. Concentrations of all investigated toxic elements were highest in mushrooms, except for Hg, which was highest in fish. EU maximum levels of Pb, Cd, and Hg were exceeded in some samples, but most had levels considered safe for human consumption. No international thresholds exist for the other elements under study.},

  abstract = {Several laboratory studies have demonstrated that exposure to oil components cause toxicity to copepods, however, this has never been shown in natural populations of copepods. In the present study, we sampled copepods in an area of the North Sea with high density of oil production platforms discharging produced water. Environmental modelling was used to predict produced water and copepod trajectories prior to copepod sampling in situ. To maximise output from a minimal number of field samples, a novel and combined methodology was developed to allow exploitation of the same extract for several purposes; contaminant body burden, lipidomics, and metabolomics analysis. PAH body burdens were low compared to laboratory experiments where correlations between PAH body burden and acute toxicity, reproduction and molecular endpoints had been established. Still, station-specific PAH profiles strongly indicated copepod exposure to PW. NMR metabolomics, focusing on water-soluble metabolites, suggested no correlation between metabolites and stations. Interestingly, lipidomics analyses suggested site-specific fingerprints and profiles displayed for acyl-glycerols and wax esters. Potential effects of produced water exposure on lipid metabolism in copepods cannot be ruled out and deserves more attention. Our study exemplifies the importance of incorporating novel and improved analytical methodologies in environmental monitoring.},

The guidance document addresses the use of weight of evidence approaches in scientific assessments using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Several case studies covering the various areas under EFSA's remit are annexed to the guidance document to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach. Weight of evidence assessment is defined in this guidance as a process in which evidence is integrated to determine the relative support for possible answers to a question. This document considers the weight of evidence assessment as comprising three basic steps: (1) assembling the evidence into lines of evidence of similar type, (2) weighing the evidence, (3) integrating the evidence. The present document identifies reliability, relevance and consistency as three basic considerations for weighing evidence.},

  abstract = {Background: Elasmobranchs are particularly vulnerable to environmental metal contamination, accumulating these contaminants at high rates and excreting them slowly. The blue shark Prionace glauca L. is one of the most heavily fished elasmobranchs, although information regarding metal contamination and detoxification in this species is notably lacking. Methods: Blue sharks were sampled in the western North Atlantic Ocean, in offshore waters adjacent to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Total and metallothionein-bound liver and muscle metal concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), metallothionein detoxification and oxidative stress endpoints were determined by UV-vis spectrophotometry. Results: Metallothionein detoxification occurred for As, Cd, Cs, Cu, Hg, Pb, Se, Ti and Zn in liver, and for As, Cd, Cs, Pb, Se, and Zn in muscle, while reduced glutathione defenses seem to be related to Co and Zn exposure. Conclusion: This is the first report for several metals (Ag, Co, non-radioactive Cs, Sb, Ti and V) for this species, which will aid in establishing baseline elemental data for biomonitoring efforts, health metrics, and conservation measures.},

  abstract = {The concentration and possible sources of heavy metal input to a high Arctic mire in Kongsfjord, West Spitsbergen were examined; levels of lead, copper and zinc are highest in the surface humus closest to the carboniferous limestone cliff upon which seabirds nest. The concentrations of iron, manganese, nickel, copper, zinc and lead in two cores of peat increase markedly in the upper 5 cm of consolidated peat, with the highest concentrations found in the uppermost centimetre of peat. There has, therefore, been an increase in heavy metal loading to this High Arctic mire within the last 100 years. This cannot be attributed to the direct input of heavy metals from precipitation or coal dust from the local mines as the concentrations of the same elements in these materials are three orders of magnitude lower. It is only in the vicinity of seabird colonies that this pattern is shown and the concentrations (mu g g(-1) dry wt.) of lead, copper and zinc in faecal samples of kittiwake and glaucous gull are in the range 17-32, 35-65 and 63-260, respectively. The concentrations of these heavy metals in the faeces are close to those found in the surface layers of humus closest to the cliff. This indicates that the seabirds are acting as a vector for the movement of heavy metals between the marine and terrestrial ecosystems.},

  abstract = {This study was designed to explore the changes in physico-chemical forms of Pb, Cu, Zn and Sb in a stream draining a contaminated shooting range, located at Steinsj{\o}en in the South-Eastern part of Norway, during a period of 21days. To obtain information on the element species distribution, an interphased size and charge fractionation system was applied, where membrane filtration (0.45microm) and ultrafiltration using hollow fibre (nominal cut off 10kDa) were performed prior to charge fractionation using chromatography (cationic and anionic exchange resins). The results show that Pb mainly was present as particulate and colloidal high molecular mass (HMM) species, Cu as colloidal (HMM) and low molecular mass (LMM) species, while Sb and Zn were mainly present as LMM species. The total element concentrations of Pb, Cu, Zn and Sb were positively correlated to water flow and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), suggesting these are important factors in controlling the run-off of the investigated elements in this catchment. During episodes of higher water flow, the increase in element concentration was mainly in the colloidal fraction. Partial redundancy analysis (pRDA) revealed that variations in pH, HMM organic carbon (HMM OC) and LMM organic carbon (LMM OC) explained 47\% of the variation in size distribution of the elements, while variations in precipitation and water flow explained 48\% of the variation in the charge distribution of the elements. The variation in concentrations during the period varied by a factor of 4, also stressing the importance of frequent sampling opposed to spot sampling in environmental surveys and risk assessments.},

In addition, metal accumulation in gills and liver, red blood cell ALA-D activity, hepatic metallothionine (Cd/Zn-MT) and oxidative stress index (GSSG/ tGSH levels) in brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) exposed to the stream were investigated. Fish, contained in cages, were exposed and sampled after 0, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11 and 23 days of exposure. Trace metals in the water were fractionated in situ according to size (nominal molecular mass) and charge properties. During the experimental period an episode with higher runoff occurred resulting in increased levels of metals in the stream. Pb and Cu were mainly found as high molecular mass species, while Zn and Sb were mostly present as low molecular mass species. Pb, Cu and Sb accumulated on gills, in addition to Al origination from natural sources in the catchment. Pb, Cu and Sb were also detected at elevated concentration in the liver. Blood glucose and plasma Na and Cl levels were significantly altered during the exposure period, and are attributed to elevated concentrations of Pb, Cu and Al. A significant suppression of ALA-D was detected after 11 days. Significant differences were detected in Cd/Zn-MT and oxidative stress (tGSH/GSSG) responses at Day 4. For Pb the results show a clear link between the HMM (high molecular mass) positively charged Pb species, followed by accumulation on gills and liver and a suppression in ALA-D. Thus, high flow episodes can remobilise metals from the catchment, inducing stress to aquatic organisms.},

  abstract = {The ongoing global climate crisis increases temperatures in polar regions faster and with greater magnitude than elsewhere. The decline of Arctic sea ice opens up new passages, eventually leading to higher anthropogenic activities such as shipping, fishing, and mining. Climate change and anthropogenic activities will increase contaminant transport from temperate to Arctic regions. The shipping industry uses copper as an antifouling coating. Copper is an essential element but becomes toxic at excess concentrations, and its use may inadvertently affect non-target organisms such as copepods. Copper affects copepods by lowering reproductive output, prolonging developmental time, and causing increased mortality. As data on copper sensitivity of polar copepods at low temperatures are rare, we conducted onboard survival experiments with the Arctic region's most common copepod species (Calanus finmarchicus, C. glacialis, C. hyperboreus). Acute survival tests were done for up to 8 days on individuals in 70\,ml bottles at 1\,{$^\circ$}C with nominal copper concentrations ranging from 3 to 480\,{$\mu$}g L-1. We used a reduced General Unified Threshold model for Survival (GUTS) to analyse the data, and placed our results in the context of the few published copper sensitivity data of the Antarctic and temperate copepod species at low temperatures. The sensitivity of Cu exposure was similar between the three Calanus species. However, a model comparison suggests that the tested C. glacialis population is less sensitive than the other two species in our experiments. Compared to published data, the three Arctic species appear slightly less sensitive to copper compared to their Antarctic counterparts but more compared to their temperate ones. Our literature search revealed only a few available studies on the copper sensitivity of polar copepods. In the future, this species group will be exposed to more pollutants, which warrants more studies to predict potential risks, especially given possible interactions with environmental factors.},

  abstract = {Historical copper mine tailings deposited in the Repparfjord, Northern Norway, provided new insight into the biogeochemical impact of submarine tailings disposals on high-latitude coastal ecosystems. The submarine tailings disposal in the Repparfjord represents a product of mining activities between 1972 and 1979. Their environmental impact has been extensively studied during the last decade, but geochemistry of the sediment pore water, which is crucial to assess and monitor the in-situ metal leaching and bioavailability, has never been analysed. The actual impact on the benthic fauna remains poorly known. Therefore, this study couples the pore water chemistry and the foraminiferal analysis obtained from selected sediment cores (gravity core, multicore, box cores) to examine metal stability and the past and current status of the foraminifera community. We measured down-core sulfate and trace metal concentrations and Eh-Ph and applied the Shannon index, the AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (F-AMBI) index and the foraminiferal abnormality index. This study confirms the ongoing leaching of Cu from the underlying mine tailings and release across the sediment-water interface. Leaching of Ni, Zn and Pb have been attributed to weathering of natural bedrock lithologies. The original benthic foraminiferal community disappeared almost entirely during the disposal period, and now it is dominated by stress-tolerant and opportunistic species like Bulimina marginata and Spiroplectammina biformis. Anyhow, against previous assumptions, the community composition changed, while the overall diversity and abnormalities (FAI) shell formation is unaffected by elevated Cu concentrations.},

Although the conditions at the start were different, the losses of weight and mortality rates were in general comparable in clams from all areas. In contrast to expectation, the accumulation of copper in (sub)Arctic clams was much faster than in temperate specimens, whereas the level of MTLP in all populations hardly increased. Copper was primarily accumulated in insoluble form: MTLP has in clams no major role in copper sequestration. It is suggested that the differences in copper accumulation rates between populations might be related to genetic (racial) differentiation.},

The primary aim was to have insight whether metals incorporation in the skeleton of Arctic echinoderms is regulated physiologically by the organism or influenced by abiotic environmental conditions (expressed as distance from the source of metal pollution). Metal concentrations were analysed in 17 species from four echinoderm classes: Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea, Crinoidea and Echinoidea. The results revealed species-specific accumulation patterns for most metals, indicating a strong biological control over metal incorporation. In crinoid Heliometra glacialis, a negative correlation between body size and skeletal concentrations of Al, Fe, Mg and Mn was observed. This correlation was ascribed to age-related metabolic traits and a likely mechanism for removing foreign metals from the skeletal calcite. The relationships between environmental factors and metal accumulation patterns were less clear. However, higher concentrations of Al, Fe, Mg, Mn and Pb were found in suspension feeders collected near glaciers, which were potential sources of suspended material. Asteroids exhibited particularly high concentrations of Cu, Fe, Cr, Hg compared to species from the other regions, suggesting that their calcified skeletons may serve as storage mechanisms to prevent toxic effects in other body parts. These observations confirm that biologically-mediated processes predominantly govern metal bioaccumulation in Arctic echinoderms.},

Fourhorn sculpins caught at the most distant site from the settlement, contained significantly higher hepatic Cu and Cd concentrations as well as significantly elevated gill Pb levels compared to the shorthorn sculpins collected at two other sites closer to the settlement. Histological examinations showed that fish with significantly higher concentrations of hepatic Cd and Se exhibited greater nuclear alterations, interstitial hyperplasia/hypertrophy, interstitial mononuclear infiltrations and granulomas. Further, fish with higher Cd and Cu gill tissue levels displayed a significantly higher number of cytoplasmic alterations and lamellar epithelium lifting, hypertrophic and hyperplastic epithelium along with mucus cell hyperplasia.

  abstract = {Aerosol deposition is an important pathway for delivering trace elements, including those of anthropogenic origin, into the Arctic. Assessment of this process is difficult in the harsh Arctic environment, and limited field studies have forced a reliance on poorly constrained models. Here we use the cosmic ray produced radioisotope, Be-7, to trace the atmospheric deposition of elements within the Arctic water/ice/snow system, and link aerosol concentrations to flux. Seawater, ice, snow, melt pond, and aerosol samples were collected during late summer 2011 as part of the RV Polarstern's ARK-XXVI/3 campaign. From the measured 7Be inventories we determined an average Be-7 flux of 109 dpm/m(2)/d, which is consistent with results from previous studies in the region. Snow, ice and melt ponds represent significant reservoirs of 7Be, and the relative Be-7 inventory in ice increased through late August, as melt pond inventories decreased with onset of freezing. The total (water/ice/snow system) inventory was relatively constant across our transect, but mixed layer inventories increased towards lower latitudes as ice-free, open water was approached. The latter gradient drives transport of 7Be, and presumably other atmospherically-derived species, towards the ice-covered ocean mixed layer. This is modeled by advective transport along the Transpolar Drift. The average Be-7 aerosol concentration was 0.0182 dpm/m(3). None of the lithogenic aerosol elements showed any significant enrichment above crustal composition, while the pollution-derived elements (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Sb, Pb) showed varying degrees of enrichment relative to crustal values. Historical aerosol Be-7 data was used to derive a seasonal cycle in the Be-7 inventory that was calibrated to the inventory measured in this study, using an effective bulk (wet plus dry) deposition velocity of 1350 m/day. This deposition velocity was then used to estimate the seasonal atmospheric flux of aerosol trace elements. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Given increasing use of copper-based nanomaterials, particularly in applications with direct release, it is imperative to understand their human and ecological risks. A comprehensive and systematic approach was used to determine toxicity and fate of several Cu nanoparticles (Cu NPs). When used as pesticides in agriculture, Cu NPs effectively control pests. However, even at low (5--20mg Cu/plant) doses, there are metabolic effects due to the accumulation of Cu and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Embedded in antifouling paints, Cu NPs are released as dissolved Cu+2 and in nano- and micron-scale particles. Once released, Cu NPs can rapidly (hours to weeks) oxidize, dissolve, and form CuS and other insoluble Cu compounds, depending on water chemistry (e.g. salinity, alkalinity, organic matter content, presence of sulfide and other complexing ions). More than 95\% of Cu released into the environment will enter soil and aquatic sediments, where it may accumulate to potentially toxic levels ({$>$}50--500{$\mu$}g/L). Toxicity of Cu compounds was generally ranked by high throughput assays as: Cu+2{$>$}nano Cu(0){$>$}nano Cu(OH)2{$>$}nano CuO{$>$}micron-scale Cu compounds. In addition to ROS generation, Cu NPs can damage DNA plasmids and affect embryo hatching enzymes. Toxic effects are observed at much lower concentrations for aquatic organisms, particularly freshwater daphnids and marine amphipods, than for terrestrial organisms. This knowledge will serve to predict environmental risks, assess impacts, and develop approaches to mitigate harm while promoting beneficial uses of Cu NPs.},

In a part of the Arctic region (the Kola Peninsula, 66-70 degrees N and 28-41 degrees E), metal levels are generally elevated in the lake sediment. There is a question as to what results in elevated metal levels-a natural process (naturally abundant minerals) or an anthropogenic process (mining and metallurgy). In terms of solving this question, Staroe lake located on the Kola Peninsula was researched as a case study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The following parameters were determined in relation with Staroe lake: (1) the current quality of the lake's water-each 1,000-ml sample was collected at a surface point and a deep point (near the bottom layer), and the collected samples were directly analyzed after filtration; (2) atmospheric bulk deposition-bulk deposition was collected using a set of three rainwater samplers near the lake. In addition, bulk deposition was collected in a background site (250 km to the southwest of the smelter complex) as a reference; and (3) sediment profile (plus principal component analysis)-lake-bottom sediment was collected by an open-gravimetric column sampler equipped with an automatic diaphragm. After collection, the sample columns were cut at a 1-cm interval for analysis. Eigenvalues and variances by factor were calculated from the correlation coefficients. RESULTS: The obtained data show that (1) naturally poor elements (Cu, Ni, Si, and SO(4) (2-)) dominantly influence the lake's water quality; (2) they are transported from the anthropogenic sources to the study lake through the atmospheric pathway; (3) mainly the contents of Cu, Ni, Sr, and Ca have influenced the sediment quality since the 1950s, corresponding to the industrial movement; and (4) Cu, Ni, and Sr originate from an anthropogenic source (smelter), and Ca originates from both natural and anthropogenic sources. DISCUSSION: As compared with the Russian standard (San Pin 2.1.980-00), the contents of NO(3) (-) (50.3 +/- 0.1 mg l(-1)) and particulates (2.3 +/- 0.2 mg l(-1)) exceeded the standard levels (0.7 mg l(-1) NO(3) (-) and 45 mg l(-1) particulates); Staroe lake may be slightly contaminated. However, the contamination factor (comparison with the background data) implies that Staroe lake is considerably contaminated. There is a strong possibility that fine overburden detritus ({$<$}0.1 mm diameter) may be transported from an open pit to the study lake by natural forces such as wind. Although it is difficult to suppose that one factor dominantly affects the sediment quality, it follows from a factor analysis that factors 1 and 2 account for about 70\% of the total variance: Factor 1 is the most dominant, and factor 2 is the second most dominant in the variability of sediment quality. It is considered that Cu, Sr, and Ni in factor 1 originate from anthropogenic sources because they are poor in sediment rocks. CONCLUSIONS: The field survey conducted in Staroe lake can give the following answers to the key objectives: (1) The present water quality is affected by Cu, Ni, Si, and SO(4) (2-) in light of the contamination factor, and these elements originate from anthropogenic sources (the smelter and the open pit) and are transported to the lake through the atmospheric pathway; (2) the sediment profile and statistic analysis show that the lake quality has been influenced by deposition of metals since the 1950s; and (3) Cu, Ni, Sr, and Ca have influenced the sediment quality in light of the most dominant factor-Cu, Ni, and Sr originate from an anthropogenic source, whereas Ca comes from both natural and anthropogenic sources. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: The presented lake survey shows that the dispersion of human-related pollutants via the atmospheric pathway takes place in the Arctic region. If the current pollution continues without countermeasures, the high-latitude environment may lose its original characteristics; hence, this subject is important when considering how to implement a wide range of environmental protection measures in the Arctic.},

  abstract = {Two laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) systems (soil LIBS and aerosol LIBS) were used to determine the elemental composition of soils and ambient aerosols less than 2.5 mu m in Ny-Alesund, Svalbard (the world's most northerly human settlement). For soil LIBS measurements, matrix effects such as moisture content, soil grain size, and surrounding gas on the LIBS response were minimized. When Ar gas was supplied onto the soil sample surfaces, a significant enhancement in LIBS emission lines was observed. Arctic soil samples were collected at 10 locations, and various elements (Al, Ba, C, Ca, Cu, Fe, H, K, Mg, Mn, N, Na, O, Pb, and Si) were detected in soils. The elemental distribution in arctic soils was clearly distinguishable from those in urban and abandoned mining soils in Korea. Moreover, the concentrations of most of anthropogenic metals were fairly low, and localized sources in extremely close proximity affected the elevated level of Cu in the soil samples derived from Ny-Alesund. The number of elements detected in aerosols (C, Ca, H, K, Mg, Na, and 0) was lower than those determined in soils. The elements in aerosols can mainly originate from minerals and sea salts. The elemental distribution in aerosols was also clearly distinguishable from that in soils, suggesting that the resuspension of local soil particles by wind erosion into aerosols was minimal. The daily variation of particle number concentration (RSD = 71\%) and the elements in aerosols (RSD = 25\%) varied substantially, possibly due to fluctuating air masses and meteorological conditions.

We have combined the results from literature with new results from 2014. The regions of Beskidy and Karkonosze were the most exposed to heavy metals deposition.

For example, the average Cd concentration in mosses samples collected in Karkonosze decreased from 0.002 mg/g in 1975 to 0.0006 mg/g in 2014. It is interesting to observe relatively large concentrations of nickel in moss samples collected in 2014 in the Svalbard archipelago, in the vicinity of Longyearbyen (average 0.018 mg/g) which most likely originate from local mine waste piles.},

  abstract = {Arctic regions experience metal pollution, despite their remote location, and the distribution and migration of those metals determine their potential impact on the local environment. Here, a High-Arctic catchment (Revelva, Svalbard) located remotely from human-induced pollution sources is studied with respect to the distribution and migration of chosen trace elements (Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Cs, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sr, Tl, U, V and Zn) in surface waters. The metal concentrations fluctuated in 2010-2012 between 0.01 and 354 mu g L-1, the highest mean-weighted concentration noted for Sr (42.5 mu g L-1). The concentrations in the river water were likely influenced by both natural and human-activity-related processes. These factors can produce substances of the same chemical composition (e.g. carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and metals may be emitted both by a volcanic eruption and by industrial sources). Therefore, chemometric techniques were used in the current paper to distinguish the multiple sources of pollution in the Revelva catchment. The authors were seeking to determine whether there is indeed evidence for contamination, sufficient to cause environmental damage in polar region. As a result, it was shown that the long-range transport could play an important role in shaping the metal concentration profile of this Arctic tundra environment, capturing both the influence of volcanic eruptions within the region and the human activity in a range of distances from the study site.},

Towards the Fuglebekken catchment, in the southern part of Spitsbergen, north of Hornsund fjord, contaminants can be transported from mainland pollution sources. In the precipitation and surface water collected in the catchment, the following elements were detected and quantified: Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Cs, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sr, Tl, U, V and Zn. Additionally, pH, electrical conductivity and total organic carbon (TOC) were determined in those samples. The acidic reaction of precipitation waters was identified as an important factor intensifying the metal migration in this Arctic tundra environment. The air mass trajectory, surprisingly, explained the variability of only a small fraction of trace elements in precipitation water. The air mass origin area was correlated only with the concentrations of As, V and Cr. Wind directions were helpful in explaining the variability of Mn, U and Ba concentrations (east-north-easterly wind) and the contents of B, As, Rb, Se, Sr and Li in precipitation (south-westerly wind), which may indicate the local geological source of those. Atmospheric deposition was found to play a key role in the transport of contaminants into the Fuglebekken catchment; however, the surface water composition was modified by its pH and TOC content.},

Hansbreen, a glacier located close to the Polish Polar Station in southern Svalbard, is a perfect site to study metals and metalloids: it has a complex geological substratum, has a year-round presence of a small group of people, and is near the coast. We analyzed a snapshot of metal and metalloid concentrations in snow samples from shallow cores corresponding to autumn, winter, and spring deposition on Hansbreen. Eighteen cores of snow were collected across the glacier, revealing the influence of potential local sources of metals and metalloids. In these samples, we predominantly found Na, Mg, and K, followed by Zn, Ca, Al, and Fe. Heavy metals, such as Bi or Hg, were also detected. Cluster analysis of the determined elemental concentrations divided them into three distinct groups: Group 1: Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Hg, Mo, Sb, Se, and Zn-the most diverse cluster, representing mostly long-range transported volatile elements, with possible extra local geological sources; Group 2: Al, Fe, Cu, and Mn-elements with crustal sources; and Group 3: Na, Ca, Mg, K, and Sr-with the main source in sea spray aerosol. The latter interpretation was confirmed by the calculation of sea salt contribution based on the composition of mean seawater and the positive significant correlation between their concentrations and the electrical conductivity of snow samples. In the study site, snow was up to six times more efficient in bringing metal pollution into terrestrial environment, when compared to rain.},

The analyses covered major and trace elements, including heavy metals, in order to describe anthropogenic impacts related to the management of the mining town. Soil samples and plant tissues were analysed from 13 localities across and close to town vicinity. The plant ground cover of all sampling points was determined, and plant tissues (leaves and stem) were collected. Higher contents of Cd (3-11 mg kg(-1)) and Mo (11-33 mg kg(-1)) were detected in the soils. With relation to the world average concentration of metals in soils, the geo-accumulation indexes (I-geo) and the level of pollution of the analysed soils were classified into seven pollution grades. The soils of the studied localities were usually unpolluted (grade 1) when analysed for metals, with the soil pollution grades 4-6 identified only for Cd and Mo (moderately to strongly polluted). In Salix polaris, excessive amounts of Fe (60-1520 mg kg(-1)), Zn (80-1050 mg kg(-1)), Cd (0.2-5.5 mg kg(-1)) and Cr (0-3.6 mg kg(-1)) were observed. The I-geo of these elements, compared with values considered sufficient for plants, showed pollution grades from 2 to 6. The pollution load index (PLI) ranged between 0.49 and 1.01. Only one locality could be considered polluted having a PLI higher than 1. Plant/soil transfer factors (TF) for trace metals decreased in the following order: Zn {$>$} Cu {$>$} Cd {$>$} Mn {$>$} Ni {$>$} As {$>$} Mo {$>$} Pb {$>$} Co {$>$} Al {$>$} Cr {$>$} Fe.

These plumes contain elevated concentrations of a range of trace metals, especially in particle bound phases, but it is not clear how these particles affect dissolved ({$<$} 0.2 mu m) metal distributions in the ocean. Here we show, using transects in 8 glacier fjords, trends in the distribution of dissolved iron, cobalt, nickel and copper (dFe, dCo, dNi, dCu). Following rapid dFe loss close to glacier outflows, dFe concentrations in particular showed strong similarities between different fjords. Similar dFe concentrations were also observed between seasons/years when Nuup Kangerlua (SW Greenland) was revisited in spring, mid- and late-summer. Dissolved Cu, dCo and dNi concentrations were more variable and showed different gradients with salinity depending on the fjord, season and year. The lack of consistent trends for dCu and dNi largely reflects less pronounced differences contrasting the concentration of inflowing shelf waters with fresher glacially-modified waters. Particles also made only small contributions to total dissolvable Cu (dCu constituted 83 +/- 28\% of total dissolvable Cu) and Ni (dNi constituted 86 +/- 28\% of total dissolvable Ni) within glacier plumes. For comparison, dFe was a lower fraction of total dissolvable Fe; 3.5 +/- 4.8\%. High concentrations of total dissolvable Fe in some inner-fjord environments, up to 77 mu M in Ameralik (SW Greenland), may drive enhanced removal of scavenged type elements, such as Co. Further variability may have been driven by local bedrock mineralogy, which could explain high concentrations of dNi (25-29 nM) and dCo (6-7 nM) in one coastal region of west Greenland (Kangaatsiaq). Our results suggest that dissolved trace element distributions in glacier fjords are influenced by a range of factors including: freshwater concentrations, local geology, drawdown by scavenging and primary production, saline inflow, and sediment dynamics. Considering the lack of apparent seasonality in dFe concentrations, we suggest that fluxes of some trace elements may scale proportionately to fjord overturning rather than directly to freshwater discharge flux.},

Generally, relatively low concentrations of toxic elements were encountered in the tissues of European porpoises, except for two individuals, which displayed high hepatic Hg concentrations. Also, elevated Cd levels obtained in Scottish porpoises could be related to their feeding preferences and this result suggests an increase of the proportion of cephalopods in their diet with latitude. Moreover, significant geographical differences were seen in hepatic Zn concentrations; the elevated Zn concentrations displayed by porpoises from the Netherlands may relate their poor health status. Variation in metal concentrations within porpoises from the North Sea is likely to reflect a long-term segregation between animals from northern (Scotland) and southern areas (the Netherlands), making trace elements powerful ecological tracers.

The procedure essentially involves the construction of functions of the observed proportions which are directed at the extent to which the observers agree among themselves and the construction of test statistics for hypotheses involving these functions. Tests for interobserver bias are presented in terms of first-order marginal homogeneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa-type statistics. These procedures are illustrated with a clinical diagnosis example from the epidemiological literature.},

We evaluated meiospore development of the kelps Macrocystis pyrifera and Undaria pinnatifida exposed to a factorial combination of current and 2100-predicted temperature (12 and 16\,{$^\circ$}C, respectively), pH (8.16 and 7.65, respectively), and two copper levels (no-added-copper and species-specific germination Cu-EC50). Meiospore germination for both species declined by 5--18\% under OA and ambient temperature/OA conditions, irrespective of copper exposure. Germling growth rate declined by {$>$}40\%{$\cdot$}day-1, and gametophyte development was inhibited under Cu-EC50 exposure, compared to the no-added-copper treatment, irrespective of pH and temperature. Following the removal of copper and 9-day recovery under respective pH and temperature treatments, germling growth rates increased by 8--18\%{$\cdot$}day-1. The exception was U. pinnatifida under OW/OA, where growth rate remained at 10\%{$\cdot$}day-1 before and after copper exposure. Copper-binding ligand concentrations were higher in copper-exposed cultures of both species, suggesting that ligands may act as a defence mechanism of kelp early life stages against copper toxicity. Our study demonstrated that copper pollution is more important than global climate drivers in controlling meiospore development in kelps as it disrupts the completion of their life cycle.},

  abstract = {The shaping of surface water chemistry in the Svalbard Archipelago is strongly dependent on the geology of the catchment and the process of long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants (LRATP). It was found that the dissolved trace elements in the Scott River, which catchment is characterized by a decreasing degree of glaciation, were of the natural origin (i.a. weathering and dissolution of local geological substratum). The exception was Zn originated from LRATP. The paper describe the influence changes in hydro-meteorological conditions and the presence of a seabird colony on the variability in the transport of trace elements within the Scott River catchment. The work assesses long-time fluctuations in the concentration of twenty five trace elements (i.a. Al, Cr, Cu, Pb, Sr, and Zn) from eighty-four surface water samples and their relation to changes in water discharge (Q), precipitation (P), pH, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at two river sites (with one being under the influence of the biotransport factor). Based on the results of matrix correlation and cluster analysis it was found that the additional load of DOC from the nesting site of Larus Argentatus in the mouth section of the river drastically changed the hydro-geochemical cycle of Co, Ni, Zn, Ga, Sr, Rb, Ba and U (0.30 {$<$} r {$<$} 0.51). Furthermore, the results of cluster analysis confirmed that the bird colony's nesting site was strongly responsible for the presence of U, Rb, Zn, Ni and marine-derived nutrients (e.g. Se and Li). The discharge of glacier meltwater and the alkaline character of water have a negative effect on the dissolution of Li and Mn (-0.31 {$<$} r {$<$} -0.51), but positively affect the level of Rb and U (r = 0.31 and 0.35, respectively) due to it being washing out a seabird nesting colony in the mouth section of the Scott River. It was observed that the event of rises in air temperature and rain, which results in increased water discharge, caused an intense transport of the trace elements load. Moreover, results of the precipitation sensitivity coefficient factor (CF) proved that precipitation effect the occurrence of Li, Sr and U in the Scott River.},

Permafrost catchments off the west coast of Svalbard, described as "thin" and "warm," are particularly sensitive to climate change. The interdisciplinary research on the hydrochemical response of surface and underground water functioning within a small permafrost catchment area focused on the determination of the impact of meteorological conditions (temperature (T), precipitation (P)) on the mean daily discharge (Q), and the lowering of the groundwater table (H). We determined physical and chemical properties (pH and SEC) and concentrations of major elements (Ca, Mg, Na, K) and 23 trace elements (i.a. Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, Zn) in 280 water samples. The results of the correlation matrix showed that an increase in the average air temperature in the summer of 2021 had a significant impact on the hydrochemistry of both types of waters operating in the catchment. In response to increase in T, the lowering of the H (0.52 {$<$} r {$<$} 0.66) and a decrease in Q (-0.66 {$<$} r {$<$} -0.68) were observed what in consequence also leads to changes in water chemistry. The principal component analysis (CA) indicates that chemical weathering and binding of elements to DOC are processes influencing water chemistry. Results of statistical analysis showed that the resultant of the hydrometeorological conditions that prevailed in that season and the type of geological formations on which they were located had a significant impact on the water chemistry at individual measurement points. Significant differences in the concentrations of elements between points on the same geological formations were also found.},

A total of 150 soil/sediment samples were collected in each location. Heavy metal concentrations were detectable levels at all sites and the values of Cd of all soil/sediment samples were higher than Dutch Target and Intervention Values. Heavy metal concentration in soil/sediment was further analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA). It was revealed that three components were found in two studying sites and contributed 60.2\% and 75.9\% of variations to reflect soil/sediment quality in CBA and GBA, respectively. Based on the results of KMO (0.52) and Bartlett's test (p {$<$} 0.000), there are 32.1\%, 15.6\%, and 11.1\% and 39.45\%, 19.01\%, and 17.52\% of the variance in the first, second, and third component explained that the metal concentration of Pb, Cd, and Sn was highly correlated with the soil/sediment quality in CBA and GBA, respectively. Among these three heavy metals, Cd concentration was the common dominant factor to affect soil/sediment quality in these two study sites. It is recommended that investigation of the sources of pollution (either point or non-point source) during CBA or GBA development and management together with consideration of abiotic (soil)-biotic (organisms) interactions should be taken into account when choosing suitable remediation strategies in the future.},

Gufunes N. lapillus presented the highest values of VDSI (4.0) and RPSI (11.1), followed by Greniv{\'i}k individuals (VDSI = 3.0; RPSI = 0.9), while the Strandakirkja population showed the lowest VDSI (0.3) and zero RPSI. At a standardised size (0.25 g dry soft-body weight), Greniv{\'i}k N. lapillus exhibited significantly higher concentrations of all metals whereas overall metal concentrations were significantly lower in individuals from Strandakirkja and Garethskagi compared to other study sites. Partial correlation analyses with size correction indicated that MT concentrations were better correlated with Cd and Cu concentrations than with other metals. At the standard size, the pattern of MT concentrations in N. lapillus from different sites was, however, very different from those of metal profiles. Such discrepancies between the patterns of MT and metals in N. lapillus might be explained by the fact that MT induction could be influenced by various factors such as temperature, dietary metal intake, growth rate and co-existence of other MT-inducing chemicals.},

However, interspecies differences in sensitivity to metals are not well understood. The relationship between metal-algal cell binding and copper sensitivity of marine microalgae was investigated using a series of 72-h growth-rate inhibition bioassays and short-term (1-h) uptake studies. A range of marine algae from different taxonomic groups were screened to determine whether copper adsorption to the cell membrane was influenced by biotic factors, such as the ultrastructure of cell walls and cell size. Minutocellus polymorphus was the most sensitive species to copper and Dunaliella tertiolecta the least sensitive, with 72-h IC50 values (concentration to inhibit growth-rate by 50\%) of 0.6 and 530~{$\mu$}g Cu/L, respectively. Copper solution-cell partition coefficients at equilibrium (Kd) were calculated for six species of algae on a per cell and surface area basis. The largest and smallest cells had the lowest and highest Kd values, respectively (on a surface area basis), with a general (non-linear) trend of decreasing Kd with increasing cell surface area (p=0.026), however, no relationship was found between Kd and copper sensitivity, nor cell size and copper sensitivity. Interspecies differences in copper sensitivity were not related to cell size, cell wall type, taxonomic group or Kd values. The differences in sensitivity may be due to differences in uptake rates across the plasma membrane, in internal binding mechanisms and/or detoxification mechanisms between the different microalgal species.},

In this study we provide a systematic review on toxicity of Cu which focuses on identifying evidence in the mechanisms of Cu toxicity, and apply an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) analysis to identify multiple potential mechanisms and their interactions of Cu toxicity to fish. This analysis process included the mechanisms of behavior toxicant, oxidative toxicant, ion regulation disruption toxicity, as well as endocrine disruption toxicity. It was found that at low levels of Cu exposure, swimming, avoid predators, locating prey and other sensory functions will be impaired, and the organism will suffer from metabolic alkalosis and respiratory acidosis following the inhibition of the carbonic anhydrase active. The main pathway of acute toxicity of Cu to fish is the inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase enzyme, and lead to reduced intracellular sodium absorption, as well as Cu-induced increased cell permeability, in turn resulting in increased sodium ion loss, leading to cardiovascular collapse and respiratory insufficiency. The endocrine disruption toxicity of Cu to fish caused growth inhibition and reproductive reduction. In addition, there are several key pathways of Cu toxicity that are affected by hardness (e.g., Ca2+) and intracellular DOC concentrations, including inhibiting Cu-induction, improving branchial gas exchange, altering membrane transport functions, decreasing Na+ loss, and increasing Na+ uptake. The results of the AOP analysis will provide a robust framework for future directed research on the mechanisms of Cu toxicity.},

Historically, assessors have relied upon qualitative WOE approaches, such as professional judgment, or limited quantitative methods, such as direct scoring, to develop conclusions from multiple lines of evidence. Current practice often lacks transparency resulting in risk estimates lacking quantified uncertainty.

These laminated black shales are characterized by high total organic carbon (TOC) and total sulfur (TS) contents as well as by significant enrichments in several redox-sensitive and/or sulfide-forming trace metals (Ag, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Re, Sb, Tl, U, V, and Zn). Enrichment factors relative to 'average shale' are comparable to those found in Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event (CTBE) black shales and Mediterranean sapropels. The Re content is high in the studied black shales, with maximum values up to 1221 ng/g. Re/Mo ratios averaging 2.3 x 10(-3) are close to the seawater value. High trace metal enrichments and Re/Mo ratios close to the seawater value point to a dominantly anoxic and sulfidic water column during black shale formation. Interbeds with higher Re/Mo ratios, especially in high-resolution sampled core sections, point to brief periods of suboxic conditions. Additionally, enhanced Zn concentrations in the black shales from the Barents Sea support the assumption that hydrothermal activity was also high during black shale deposition. Trace metal signatures of black shales at different drill sites on a transect along the Norwegian Shelf are not only influenced by water depth but also by their location in the boreal realm. Metal enrichments are higher in the northern compared to the southern sites. Volgian (=Tithonian 151-144 Ma BP) black shales exhibit elevated trace metal contents in comparison to their Berriasian (144-137 Ma BP) counterparts. This probably reflects a change in the circulation pattern during periods of black shale formation. Therefore different paleoceanographic conditions, probably controlled by climatic change linked to the transgression of the paleo-sealevel and the North Atlantic opening, may have developed from the Volgian to the Berriasian.

In this study, trace element concentrations (Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn) were analysed from the mantle muscle and the digestive gland tissue of juveniles, adult females, and adult males that were captured south of Disko Island off West-Greenland. To assess the feeding habitat and trophic position of this species, stable isotopes of carbon ({$\delta$}(13)C) and nitrogen ({$\delta$}(15)N) were measured in their muscle tissue. Mercury concentrations were positively correlated with size (mantle length) and trophic position. The Hg/Se ratio was assessed because Se has been suggested to play a protective role against Hg toxicity and showed a molar surplus of Se relative to Hg. Cadmium concentrations in the digestive gland were negatively correlated with size and trophic position ({$\delta$}(15)N), which suggested a dietary shift from Cd-rich crustaceans towards Cd-poor fish during ontogeny. This study provides trace element concentration data for G.~fabricii from Greenlandic waters, which represents baseline data for a northern cephalopod species. Within West-Greenland waters, G.~fabricii appears to be an important vector for the transfer of Cd in the Arctic pelagic food web.},

Lithogenic radionuclides (Th-230, Th-232, U-234, U-238) show less variability than the airborne radionuclides because their activity concentrations are controlled by mixing of local material derived from different types of bedrock.Activity ratios of the artificial radionuclides in most cryoconite samples differ from global fallout signatures. The contribution of radionuclides from additional and more specific sources might be enhanced by non-continuous exposure of cryoconite to atmospheric deposition. We assumed that the main source of Pu, which was detected only in cryoconite samples, is derived from nuclear tests and non-exploded weapons-grade material. Approximately one-third of the total observed Pu activity concentration is Pu-238, most likely originating from the SNAP9A satellite re-entry, which was powered by a Pu-238 thermoelectric generator. In samples from Waldemarbreen the influence of glacial local morphology on the capability of cryoconite for trapping and accumulating airborne radionuclides is apparent. Local glacial morphology plays an important role in determining the accumulation of airborne pollutants. Trace metal concentrations in soils were typical or slightly higher than concentrations characteristic for the natural background; the Pb-206/Pb-207 signature was also close to the natural ratio of the parent rocks. Conversely, trace metal concentrations in cryoconite samples (Pb and Cd) were higher than in soil samples and exceeded natural values. Cryoconite is an effective monitor of the spread of artificial radionuclides and heavy metals in their surrounding environment.},

Despite fact that glaciers and ice sheets constitute significance part of land surface, reservoir of freshwater, and sites of high biological production, the knowledge on the cryoconite granules still remain unsatisfactory. This study presents information on radionuclide and heavy metal contents in cryoconites. Cryoconites collected from the Hans Glacier in SW Spitsbergen reveal high activity concentrations of anthropogenic ((238,239,240)Pu, (137)Cs, (90)Sr) and natural ((210)Pb) radionuclides. The (238)Pu/(239+240)Pu activity ratios in these cryoconites significantly exceed the mean global fallout ratio (0.025). The (238)Pu/(239+240)Pu ranged from 0.064 to 0.118. The (239+240)Pu/(137)Cs varied from 0.011~{\textpm}~0.003 to 0.030~{\textpm}~0.007. Such activity ratios as observed in these cryoconites were significantly higher than the values characterizing global fallout, pointing to possible contributions of these radionuclides from other sources. Heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Fe, and Mn) in cryoconites exceed both UCC concentrations and local rocks' concentrations, particularly for cadmium. The concentration ratios of stable lead isotopes ((206)Pb/(207)Pb, (208)Pb/(206)Pb) were determined to discriminate between the natural and anthropogenic sources of Pb in cryoconites and to confirm the strong anthropogenic contribution to heavy metal deposition in the Arctic. In investigated cryoconite holes, two groups of invertebrates, both extremophiles, Tardigrada and Rotifera were detected. Our study indicate that cryoconites are aggregates of mineral and organic substances on surfaces of glaciers are able to accumulate large amounts of airborne pollutants bound to extracellular polymeric substances secreted by microorganisms.},

Sea anemones act as bioindicators of pollution due to their ability to accumulate contaminants. To mitigate pollution, strict environmental regulations, monitoring programs, and innovative solutions like algae farms are recommended.

We made use of the Norwegian Oil Industrial Association database and extracted concurrently obtained data on species density and contaminant levels in sediment samples collected between 1996 and 2001. In brief, effect concentrations (ECs) of each installation (i.e., oil platform) at a given reduction in species density were firstly derived by fitting a logistic-type regression function to the relationship between the species density and the corresponding concentration of a chemical of concern. The estimated ECs were further improved by the NEBM which incorporated information from other installations. The distribution of these improved ECs from all installations was determined nonparametrically by the kernel method, and then used to determine the hazardous concentration (HC) which can be directly linked to the species loss (or the species being protected) in the sediment. This method also enables an accurate estimation of the lower confidence limit of the HC, even when the number of observations was small. To illustrate the effectiveness of this novel technique, barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, lead, tetrahydrocannabinol, and zinc were chosen as example contaminants. This novel approach can generate ecologically sound SQGs for environmental risk assessment and cost-effectiveness analysis in sediment remediation or mud disposal projects, since sediment quality is closely linked to species density.},

Both of these species feed mostly on fish and crustaceans but have different foraging strategies, kittiwakes being surface feeders while guillemots are divers. We investigated the concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) in the plasma and body feathers of black-legged kittiwakes (n~=~17), as well as in the body feathers of Br{\"u}nnich's guillemots (n~=~13). Samples were collected from adult birds at two time points, one week apart during July 2017 in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. Of the non-essential trace elements, As was found at the highest median concentration at both the first (56.23~ng/g ww) and second (39.99~ng/g ww) sampling timepoints in the kittiwake plasma. When separating for the sexes, as well as sampling time, males sampled at the first sampling time point had significantly higher concentrations of As (median at 0.087~ng/g versus 0.039~ng/g) and Se (median 0.26~ng/g versus 0.16~ng/g) compared to males sampled at the second time point. There was no significant difference in plasma concentrations between females at first and second sampling time points. Kittiwake feathers contained significantly higher concentrations of As, Cd and Hg than guillemot feathers, while guillemot feathers had significantly higher concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn. However, of the non-essential elements in both kittiwake and guillemot feathers Hg was found with the highest median concentrations at 5160 and 1080~ng/g, respectively, thus in kittiwakes exceeding the level of 5000~ng/g associated with adverse effect (e.g., impaired reproduction). Levels of Hg and Se found in the kittiwake feathers were higher than previous studies on seabirds in the Arctic.},

Their steady-state concentration is a balance between production and elimination providing certain steady-state ROS level. The dynamic equilibrium can be disturbed leading to enhanced ROS level and damage to cellular constituents which is called ``oxidative stress''. This review describes the general processes responsible for ROS generation in aquatic animals and critically analyses used markers for identification of oxidative stress. Changes in temperature, oxygen levels and salinity can cause the stress in natural and artificial conditions via induction of disbalance between ROS production and elimination. Human borne pollutants can also enhance ROS level in hydrobionts. The role of transition metal ions, such as copper, chromium, mercury and arsenic, and pesticides, namely insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides along with oil products in induction of oxidative stress is highlighted. Last years the research in biology of free radicals was refocused from only descriptive works to molecular mechanisms with particular interest to ones enhancing tolerance. The function of some transcription regulators (Keap1--Nrf2 and HIF-1{$\alpha$}) in coordination of organisms' response to oxidative stress is discussed. The future directions in the field are related with more accurate description of oxidative stress, the identification of its general characteristics and mechanisms responsible for adaptation to the stress have been also discussed. The last part marks some perspectives in the study of oxidative stress in hydrobionts, which, in addition to classic use, became more and more popular to address general biological questions such as development, aging and pathologies.},

The risk assessment is based on a literature review and evaluations of water chemical data from the 1995 Nordic Lake Survey. Compared to the pre-liming period, it us unlikely that enhanced remobilization of inorganic aluminium (Al) or other toxic metals (metal bomb hypothesis) from the catchment, the lake sediment and/or the streambed will occur when limed waters reacidify. Rather, the concentrations in surface waters are expected to be lower than before liming started, because of reduced atmospheric inputs of both strong acids and metals as Cd, Hg, Pb, and Zn during the last 10-20 yr. The concentrations in lakes relative to the biological effect levels, as well as the chemical properties of the different metals suggest that the potential biological risks associated to reacidification of limed lakes decrease in the order Al {$>>$} Cd {$>$} Pb. The risks associated with Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn are very low and do not have to be considered except in waters with known concentrations larger than the lowest biological risk level. Such waters are very rare ({$<$}2\%). Aluminium is the metal that should be used to set the limit for judging the risk of biological damage due to reacidification of limed surface waters.},

The plants can be ideal bioindicators of element contamination in environments, but information on the element enrichment and sources of plants remains limited in polar regions. Here, concentrations of 15 metals and metalloids (Pb, Ni, Cr, Cu, Co, As, Cd, Sb, Hg, Se, Fe, Zn, Mn, Al, and Ti) in six species of plants, Deschampsia caespitosa (Tufted Hair Grass), Puccinellia phryganodes (Creeping Alkaligrass), Saxifraga aizoides (Yellow Mountain Saxifrage), Dicranum angustum (Dicranum Moss), Salix Polaris (Polar Willow), and Cerastium arcticum (Arctic Mouse-Ear Chickweed), collected from Ny-angstrom lesund, the Arctic, were determined, and enrichment and sources of elements were assessed. Results show that element concentrations vary in different plant species, and element levels in D. angustum and C. arcticum are generally higher. In spatial terms, elevated element concentrations were found near residential areas, while low element levels were present at the sites far from settlement points. Enrichment assessment shows that Cd, Hg, and Zn are the most enriched elements, with enrichment factors above 30, suggesting sources other than soil dust control their concentrations. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the extracted three components can explain 82\% of the total variance in element concentrations. The elements Ni, Cr, As, Sb, Fe, Al, Ti, and to a lesser extent Co are highly loaded in PC1, possibly associated with continental crust particles. PC2 is closely correlated with Cd, Se, Mn, Cu, and Zn, while Hg and Pb have high loadings on PC3. The elements highly loaded on PC2 and PC3 are likely associated with pollutants from atmospheric transportation. Together with enrichment assessment, the investigated plants have a great potential for monitoring atmospheric Cd, Hg, and Zn pollution in Ny-angstrom lesund, and D. angustum and D. caespitosa are the more sensitive species. The results would be of significance for monitoring element contamination in the pristine Arctic environments using the bioindicator plants.},

However, the harvested mussels must not be severely contaminated by pollutants posing a potential health risk for the consumers. The present study estimated the bioaccumulation of cadmium, copper, nickel, lead and zinc in suspended blue mussels (Mytilus edulis L) in the Limfjorden, Denmark, based on observations and modelling. Modelling was used to assess the suitability of suspended blue mussels as animal feed and food products at sea water metal concentrations corresponding to Good Ecological Status (GES) in the European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD) and in future climate change scenarios (higher metal concentrations and higher temperatures). For this purpose, GES is interpreted as good chemical status for the metals using the Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) defined in the WFD priority substance daughter directives. Observations showed that suspended mussels were healthy with respect to metal pollution and generally less polluted than benthic mussels due to the smaller contact with the contaminated sediment. The model results showed that the WFD targets for Cd, Ni and Pb are not protective with respect to marine mussel production and probably should be reduced for marine waters. Climate changes may increase the metal contamination of mussels, but not to any critical level at the relatively unpolluted study sites. In conclusion, WFD targets should be revised to assure that the corresponding body burdens of metals in mussels are below the safety limits according to the EU Directives and the Norwegian classification for animal feed and food production.

Here, geophysical and geochemical measurements were performed at four sites on a north - south transect along the Pasvik River in the Barents Region (northern Norway). These sites are influenced by depositions from the Bj{\o}rnevatn iron mine and a Ni-Cu smelter in Nikel, Russia. To relate the degree and type of pollution from these sources to the corresponding magnetic signal, the topsoil concentrations of 12 Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs) (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, Ti, Zn), were determined, magnetic hysteresis parameters and thermomagnetic properties were measured. In situ magnetic low-field susceptibility decreases from north to south with increasing distance from the iron mine. Relatively large magnetic multidomain grains of magnetite and/or titanomagnetite are responsible for the strong magnetic signal from the topsoil close to Bj{\o}rnevatn. These particles are related to increased enrichment factors of As, Mo and Cu, yielding high positive correlation coefficients with susceptibility values. At a site furthest away from the iron mine and located 7\,km from the Ni-Cu smelter magnetic susceptibility values are much lower but significant positive correlations on the level of p\,{$<$}\,.1 with 8 PTEs (Ni, Cu, Co, Se, As, Zn, Cd, Cr) have been observed. The magnetic signal in this area is due to fine-grained primary sulphides and secondary fine-grained magnetite and/or maghemite.},

The organic carbon normalized isotherm parameters for the sediments are compared to those reported for soils and sludges. The comparisons for cadmium exhibit differences for which no ready explanations are available. For copper and lead, however, the differences can be attributed to the use of specific ion electrodes for measuring metal activity in the sediment experiments. The cadmium sediment partition coefficients contribute a small increment to the sediment quality criteria.

The highest mean concentrations of Pb (13~g/kg), Cu (5.2~g/kg), Zn (1.1~g/kg), and Sb (0.83~g/kg) in the top soil were from a range located on a poor minerotrophic and acidic mire. This range had also the highest concentrations of Pb, Cu, Zn, and Sb in discharge water (0.18~mg/L Pb, 0.42~mg/L Cu, 0.63~mg/L Zn, and 65~{$\mu$}g/L Sb) and subsurface soil water (2.5~mg/L Pb, 0.9~mg/L Cu, 1.6~mg/L Zn, and 0.15~mg/L Sb). No clear differences in the discharge of ammunition residues between the mires were observed based on the characteristics of the mires. In surface water with high pH (pH {\textasciitilde}7), there was a trend with high concentrations of Sb and lower relative concentrations of Cu and Pb. The relatively low concentrations of ammunition residues both in the soil and soil water, 20~cm below the top soil, indicates limited vertical migration in the soil. Channels in the mires, made by plant roots or soil layer of less decomposed materials, may increase the rate of transport of contaminated surface water into deeper soil layers and ground water. A large portion of both Cu and Sb were associated to the oxidizable components in the peat, which may imply that these elements form inner-sphere complexes with organic matter. The largest portion of Pb and Zn were associated with the exchangeable and pH-sensitive components in the peat, which may imply that these elements form outer-sphere complexes with the peat.},

  abstract = {A combined assessment on the levels and distribution profiles of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and trace elements in soils from Pyramiden (Central Spitsbergen, Svalbard Archipelago) is here reported. As previously stated, long-range atmospheric transport, coal deposits and previous mining extractions, as well as the stack emissions of two operative power plants at this settlement are considered as potential sources of pollution. Eight top-layer soil samples were collected and analysed for the 16 US EPA priority PAHs and for 15 trace elements (As, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sn, TI, V and Zn) during late summer of 2014. The highest levels of PAHs and trace elements were found in sampling sites located near two power plants, and at downwind from these sites. The current PAH concentrations were even higher than typical threshold values. The determination of the pyrogenic molecular diagnostic ratios (MDRs) in most samples revealed that fossil fuel burning might be heavily contributing to the PAHs levels. Two different indices, the Pollution Load Index (PLI) and the Geoaccumulation Index (Igeo), were determined for assessing soil samples with respect to trace elements pollution. Samples collected close to the power plants were found to be slightly and moderately polluted with zinc (Zn) and mercury (Hg), respectively. The Spearman correlation showed significant correlations between the concentrations of 16 PAHs and some trace elements (Pb, V, Hg, Cu, Zn, Sn, Be) with the organic matter content, indicating that soil properties play a key role for pollutant retention in the Arctic soils. Furthermore, the correlations between Sigma 16 PAHs and some trace elements (e.g., Hg, Pb, Zn and Cu) suggest that the main source of contamination is probably pyrogenic, although the biogenic and petrogenic origin of PAHs should not be disregarded according to the local geology.},

  abstract = {The Arctic region is undergoing significant changes in climate, with a notable decrease in summertime sea ice coverage over the past three decades. This trend means an increasing proportion of Arctic Ocean surface waters can receive direct deposition of material from the atmosphere, potentially influencing marine biogeochemical cycles and delivery of pollutants to the Arctic ecosystem. Here, we present aerosol concentrations of selected trace elements (Al, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) measured during the US GEOTRACES Western Arctic cruise (GN01, also known as HLY1502) in August-October 2015. Concentrations of "lithogenic" elements (Al, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, and Co) were similar to those measured in remote and predominantly marine-influenced air masses in previous studies, reflecting the remoteness of the Arctic Ocean from major dust sources. Concentrations of Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd showed significant enrichments over crustal values, and were often of similar magnitude to concentrations measured over the North Atlantic in air masses of North American or European provenance. We use Be-7 inventory and flux data from GN01 to estimate a bulk atmospheric deposition velocity during the study period, and combine it with our aerosol concentrations to calculate atmospheric deposition fluxes of the trace elements in the Arctic region during late summer. The resulting estimates for mineral dust and Fe deposition fall at the low end of global estimates and confirm the Arctic Ocean as a low-dust environment during the summer months.This article is part of a special issue entitled: Conway GEOTRACES - edited by Tim M.

  abstract = {Melt ponds are a prominent feature of Arctic sea ice during the summer and play a role in the complex interface between the atmosphere, cryosphere and surface ocean. During melt pond formation and development, micronutrient and contaminant trace elements (TEs) from seasonally accumulated atmospheric deposition are mixed with entrained sedimentary and marine-derived material before being released to the surface ocean during sea ice melting. Here we present particulate and size-fractionated dissolved (truly soluble and colloidal) TE data from five melt ponds sampled in late summer 2015, during the US Arctic GEOTRACES (GN01) cruise. Analyses of salinity, delta O-18, and Be-7 indicate variable contributions to the melt ponds from snowmelt, melting sea ice, and surface seawater. Our data highlight the complex TE biogeochemistry of late summer Arctic melt ponds and the variable importance of different sources for specific TEs. Dissolved TE concentrations indicate a strong influence from seawater intrusion for V, Ni, Cu, Cd, and Ba. Ultrafiltration methods reveal dissolved Fe, Zn, and Pb to be mostly colloidal (0.003-0.2 mu m), while Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, and Cd are dominated by a truly soluble ( {$<$} 0.003 mu m) fraction. Isotopically light dissolved Fe in some melt ponds suggests that photochemical and/or biologically driven redox cycling also takes place. Comparisons of particulate TE/Al ratios to mean crustal values indicate influences from lithogenic sources, including natural aerosols and/or sedimentary material, with significant enrichments for some elements, including Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb, that may result from anthropogenic aerosols, biogenic material, and/or in situ scavenging of dissolved TEs. Our results indicate that melt ponds represent a transitional environment in which some atmospherically-derived TEs undergo physical and/or chemical changes before their release to the surface ocean. As a result, the ongoing changes in sea ice areal extent, thickness, and melt season length are likely to influence the bioavailability of atmospheric TE input to the surface Arctic Ocean, with material released from snow and sea ice via melt ponds earlier in the summer and with more extensive direct deposition to the ocean surface.},

The cells of their immune system, known as coelomocytes, are the first line of defence against environmental hazards. Here, we report the results of investigations on the immune cells response of sea stars exposed to marine environmental pollution for long periods. We show that levels of the heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) in coelomocytes from A. rubens, which were collected during a field study in the Sorfjord (North Sea, SW coast of Norway) along a contamination gradient, are directly associated with the long-term accumulation of Cd, Cu heavy metals exclusively in the tegument. Conversely, Pb and Zn accumulation in the tegument did not relate to HSC70 levels and none of the metals were found accumulated in the pyloric coeca. In addition the coelomocytes from A. rubens, collected in high and low metal impacted stations were examined by a proteomic approach using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). By comparison of the proteomic maps, we observed that 31 protein spots differed in their relative abundance, indicating a gene expression response to the metal mixture exposure. All together, our results confirm that the echinoderm immune cells are a suitable model for the assessment of long-term exposure to environmental pollution, moreover that the increased level of HSC70 can be considered a signal of an acquired tolerance within a large spectrum of protein profile changes occurring in response to metal contamination.

Laboratory tests investigated the effects of flushing media, temperatures and light-exposure on the reactivity and acid generation potential of the tailing. Based on low sulphide and carbonate concentrations, ambiguous static test results categorized the tailing as 'uncertain to potential-acid-generating'. Over a 20-week kinetic test programme, tailing leachates remained circum-neutral and metal release rates decreased substantially after the first-flush. However, Canadian Interim Quality guidelines for marine sediment were exceeded for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn by factors ranging between 1.5 (Zn) and 196 (As) and kinetic leachate concentrations of Cd exceeded Canadian Marine Aquatic Life guidelines suggesting potentially harmful effects might occur upon disposal of the tailing in marine environment. Leaching of ecotoxic elements was enhanced by the use of seawater as flushing medium. Changes in temperature and light exposure had only minor effects. In-situ long-term ({$>$} 20 weeks) leaching tests are proposed.},

  abstract = {There is little doubt that Arctic ecosystems will continue to face unprecedented change in the coming decades. The identification of food web structures that confer stability to these systems is, therefore, a priority. Here, we use stable isotopes and fatty acids to resolve the food web structure of a seasonally ice-covered fjord (Cumberland Sound, Baffin Island, Canada) sampled in late summer. We show that the food web is structured such that upper trophic levels couple separate energy channels (based on phytoplankton or macroalgae), a previously documented food web structure that has been linked with stability in temperate ecosystems, but never established in a seasonally dynamic, ice-covered ecosystem. Herbivorous zooplankton (e.g. Calanus hyperboreus) relied exclusively on phytoplankton, whereas herbivorous benthos used either phytodetritus (e.g. Hiatella arctica) or macroalgae (e.g. Tectura testudinalis), supporting the existence of separate energy channels. Upper trophic level fishes and marine mammals relied more heavily on phytoplankton-than macroalgal-derived carbon (58 to 100\% reliance on phytoplankton), but 6 out of 8 species sampled derived energy from both carbon sources. Since benthic invertebrate predators used both phytodetrital- and macrolgal-based resources, the coupling of separate energy channels was also iterated within the benthos. The temporally pulsed nature of phytoplankton production, characteristic of Arctic seas, indicates that Arctic consumers also act as couplers of resources in time because phytoplankton-and detrital-based carbon would likely reach upper trophic levels earlier and later in the season, respectively. Potential changes in the relative production of macroalgae and phytoplankton under climate change scenarios could impact the stability-promoting food web structure reported here.},

In the present study, traffic related contaminants were quantified in tunnel wash water (the Nordby tunnel, Norway) discharged from a sedimentation pond to a nearby small stream, Arungselva. In situ size and charge fractionation techniques were applied to quantify traffic related metal species, while PAHs were quantified in total samples. All metals and several PAHs appeared at elevated concentrations in the discharged wash water compared with concentrations measured in Arungselva upstream the pond outlet, and to concentrations measured in the pond outlet before the tunnel wash event. In addition, several contaminants (e.g. Cu, Pb, Zn, fluoranthene, pyrene) exceeded their corresponding EQS. PAH and metals like Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe and Pb were associated with particles and colloids, while As, Ca, K, Mg, Mo, Ni, Sb and Zn were more associated with low molecular mass species ({$<$}10kDa). Calculated enrichment factors revealed that many of the metals were derived from anthropogenic sources, originating most likely from wear of tires (Zn), brakes (Cu and Sb), and from road salt (Na and Cl). The enrichment factors for Al, Ba, Ca, Cr, Fe, K, Mg and Ni were low, suggesting a crustal origin, e.g. asphalt wear. Based on calculated PAH ratios, PAH seemed to originate from a mixture of sources such as wear from tires, asphalt and combustion. Finally, historical fish length measurement data indicates that the fish population in the receiving stream Arungselva may have been adversely influenced by the chemical perturbations in runoffs originating from the nearby roads and tunnels during the years, as the growth in summer old sea trout (Salmo trutta L.) in downstream sections of the stream is significantly reduced compared to the upstream sections.},

In the present study, meals were produced from Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), Arctic krill (Thysanoessa inermis) and the Arctic amphipod Themisto libellula. Diets were then prepared for Atlantic salmon and Atlantic cod where up to 100\% of the fish meal protein was replaced by protein from these organisms. Concentrations of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) were determined by ICP-MS in the various krill and amphipod meals, complete diets and muscle samples from fish fed these diets. The element concentrations were related to growth and general fish health as well as present EU legislations on feed ingredients and complete diets. The cod showed no difference in growth during the trial, while salmon fed diets where 40\% of the fish meal protein was replaced with Arctic krill or amphipod meal shoved improved SGR during the first period of feeding (first 100 days). No adverse effects on growth rate or fish health were observed in any fish species or treatment. Nevertheless, high levels of Cu were found in the meal from Antarctic krill (46 mg kg(-1) dry matter (dm)) resulting in a dietary level of Cu exceeding the upper limit for complete feedingstuff set by EU. Furthermore, the Cd level found in the meal from amphipod (12 mg kg(-1) dm) was 6 times higher than EU's upper limit. This indicates limitations for the use of certain zooplanktons as alternative protein sources in feed for farmed fish, unless future processing methods yield lower levels of these unwanted elements.

It is currently unclear if this has an impact on the skeleton function or if this can be considered as a detoxification mechanism. In the present work, populations of the sea urchin Echinus acutus and the starfish Asterias rubens were studied in stations distributed along a metal contamination gradient in a Norwegian fjord (S{\o}rfjord). Ossicles involved in major mechanical functions - sea urchin spine and starfish ambulacral plate - were analyzed for their metal concentration (Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) and their biometric and mechanical properties. Starfish plates were more contaminated by Cd, Pb and Zn than sea urchin spines. Cu concentrations were at background levels. In E. acutus, metals principally affected size. In A. rubens, material stiffness and toughness were decreased in the most contaminated station. This reduction is attributed either to the direct incorporation of metals in the calcite lattice and/or to deleterious effects of metals during skeleton ontogenesis. The contrasting incorporation of metals in the skeleton of the two investigated species accounts for the different impact of the metals, including in terms of fitness. The present results clearly indicate that, at least in A. rubens, incorporation of metals in the skeleton cannot be considered as a detoxification mechanism.},

This paper examines the treatment of roadside snowmelt in bioretention with respect to pollutant removal, pollutant pathways, and major sinks. Bioretention was used to treat snowmelt from three types of urban roads in Trondheim, Norway: residential, medium, and roads with high-density traffic. Metal retention in bioretention boxes had a mass reduction in zinc, copper, lead, and cadmium in the range of 89-99\%, and a decrease in outflow concentrations in the range 81-99\%. Cadmium was only measured in the water samples, while the other three metals were traced through the system to identify the main sinks. The top mulch layer was the largest sink for the retained metals, with up to 74\% of the zinc retained in this mulch layer. The plant metal uptakes were only 2-8\% of the total metal retention; however, the plants still play an important role with respect to root zone development and regeneration, which fosters infiltration and reduces the outflow load. Dissolved pollutants in snowmelt tend to be removed with the first flush of meltwater, creating an enrichment ratio with respect to the average pollutant concentrations in the snow. The effect of this enrichment ratio was examined through the bioretention system, and found to be less predominant than that typically reported for untreated snowmelt. The enrichment factors were in the range of 0.65-1.51 for the studied metals.},

  abstract = {Geochronological reconstruction of environmental parameters is an effective method for studying processes related to climatic and anthropogenic factors. To this end, sediment cores were collected in August 2022 from Gr{\o}nfjorden in the Svalbard archipelago. The bottom sediment layers were dated using the excess (210)Pb method, covering a period of up to 150~years. The concentrations of heavy metals (11 elements) and the activity concentrations of (137)Cs were measured for each layer. Additionally, the change in the distribution coefficient (K(d)s) of cesium between water and bottom sediments was examined in relation to the granulometric composition of the sediment. The study found a direct proportional relationship between the K(d)s value and the content of the pelite fraction ({$<$}\,0.01~mm) and an inverse relationship with the aleurite content (0.01-0.05~mm). The highest levels of (137)Cs in water, as reconstructed using time-varying K(d)s, were 11\,{\textpm}\,4~Bq~m(-3) between 1985 and 1995. The IAEA's recommended K(d)s values were utilized to calculate the concentrations of heavy metals in the water. For the first group of elements, which includes As, Pb, Fe, Zn, Co, and V, the concentrations in the water varied by\,{\textpm}\,10\%. The second group, consisting of Cd, Hg, Cu, and Mn, exhibited significant variations in their values. Peaks of Cd and Hg were recorded from the onset of coal mining until the beginning of World War II. The concentration of copper in the water increased after coal mining resumed.},

In a selected number of liver (seven) and fat (three) samples, the composition of individual PCB congeners was studied by comparison with 23 individual PCB congeners (IUPAC nos. 28, 52, 74, 101, 99, 110, 149, 118, 114, 105, 153, 141, 138, 187, 128, 183. 156, 157, 180, 170, 194,206 and 209). In the seven liver samples, the concentrations of o,p'- and p,p'-isomers of DDT, TDE, DDE, alpha-, beta- and gamma-HCH, oxychlordane, heptachlor, heptachlorepoxide, aldrin and dieldrin were also determined. The hepatic concentrations of mercury, cadmium and lead in animals of all ages were 0.4-6.0, {$<$} 0.1-1.2, and {$<$} 0.5-1.6-mu-g g-1, respectively. This indicates a moderate exposure. Concentrations of mercury and selenium were correlated (r = 0.80). The levels of copper and zinc represented nor-mal physiological concentrations. The concentrations of HCB, DDE and PCBs in fat were {$<$} 0.05-1.5, {$<$} 0.1-3.4 and 2.9-90-mu-g g-1, respectively. The corresponding results for liver were {$<$} 0.01-0.11, {$<$} 0.1-0.5 and 0.1-78-mu-g g-1, respectively. Six PCB congeners, PCB-99, -153, -138, -180, -170 and -194 accounted for about 99 and 87\% of the total PCB content (sum of the 12 congeners, nos. 28, 99, 153, 138, 128 + 187, 156, 157, 180, 170, 194, 206 and 209) in liver and fat, respectively. PCB-153 represented 37 +/- 3 and 30 +/- 16\% of the sum PCB (sum of 12 congeners) in liver and fat, respectively. The range of the hepatic concentration of oxychlordane was 5-19-mu-g g-1. Quantifiable concentrations of heptachlor, heptachlorepoxide, beta-HCH and dieldrin were also found in all the liver samples analysed. Low concentrations of p,p'- and o,p'-DDT were found in two of seven liver and two of two fat samples. Comparisons are made with investigations from Canada and Greenland. Possible effects of PCBs, especially on reproduction, cannot be excluded. Ringed seal, Foca hispida, and to some extent bearded seal, Erignathus barbatus, are the main food of the polar bear. It is therefore likely that the exposure to environmental pollutants occurs via the consumption of these two species.},

We studied the interaction of culturable aquatic (Pseudomonas saponiphila) and soil (Pseudomonas aureofaciens) Gammaproteobacteria with seven different organic substrates collected in subarctic settings. These included peat leachate, pine crown throughfall, fen, humic lake, stream, river, and oligotrophic lake with variable dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (from 4 to 60mgL(-1)). The highest removal of DOC over 4days of reaction was observed in the presence of P. aureofaciens (33{\textpm}5\%, 43{\textpm}3\% and 53{\textpm}7\% of the initial amount in fen water, humic lake and stream, respectively). P. saponiphila degraded only 5\% of DOC in fen water but did not affect all other substrates. Trace elements (TE) were essentially controlled by short-term (0-1h) adsorption on the surface of cells. Regardless of the nature of organic substrate and the identity of bacteria, the degree of adsorption ranged from 20 to 60\% for iron (Fe(3+)), 15 to 55\% for aluminum (Al), 10 to 60\% for manganese (Mn), 10 to 70\% for nickel (Ni), 20 to 70\% for copper (Cu), 10 to 60\% for yttrium (Y), 30 to 80\% for rare earth elements (REE), and 15 to 50\% for uranium (U(VI)). Rapid adsorption of organic and organo-mineral colloids on bacterial cell surfaces is novel and potentially important process, which deserves special investigation. The long-term removal of dissolved Fe and Al was generally consistent with solution supersaturation degree with respect to Fe and Al hydroxides, calculated by visual Minteq model. Overall, the biomass-normalized biodegradability of various allochthonous substrates by culturable bacteria is much lower than that of boreal DOM by natural microbial consortia.},

  abstract = {Multivariate statistical analyses of data on environmental variables and benthic fauna from 14 oil and gas fields obtained from 24 surveys collected between 1985 and 1993 are presented. At all fields oil-based drilling mud was used. The purpose of this study was to investigate contamination gradients, assess effects on benthic fauna both spatially and temporally and to evaluate measures such as diversity indices, indicator species and multivariate analysis techniques in assessment of pollution. Results from analyses of baseline surveys of environmental variables and fauna were characterised by a lack of distinct gradients in station placement, having a typical shot-gun pattern in PCA-, DCA- and MDS-ordination analyses. Likewise there was no consistency in which environmental variables correlated with the fauna. Contamination was assessed using all the physical and chemical data in classification and PCA-ordination analyses. Clear patterns were found using 4 categories, conveniently termed initial, moderate, severe and gross. The categories were usually apparent as rings radiating from the platform. Initial contamination of the outermost areas at most fields was shown as elevated levels of barium and total hydrocarbons (THC) and sometimes also by elevated levels of zinc, copper, cadmium and lead. Three fields were studied in particular and showed contaminated areas of over 100 km(2) (Valhall), over 15 km(2) (Gyda) and over 10 km(2) (Veslefrikk). After a period of 6 to 9 yr contamination had spread, so that nearly all of the outermost stations 2 to 6 km away from the platforms showed evidence of contamination. Thus, the existing sampling design is no longer suitable for assessment of the area contaminated. Effects on the fauna showed, as with contamination, 4 categories. Analyses linking fauna and environmental variables indicated that the effects were mainly related to THC, barium and strontium, but also to metals Like zinc, copper, cadmium and lead, which are all discharged in drill-cuttings. Effects on the fauna closely followed the patterns of contamination with only a few stations at each field that were contaminated not showing effects. Thus the areas showing effects were only slightly less than the areas contaminated. Subsequent to cessation of discharges biodegradation of oil and reduced concentrations of THC were observed. Yet there was an extension of areas where the fauna was affected several years after cessation of drill-cutting discharges. This may indicate that barite and related compounds associated with the discharges also have an environmental impact. However, preliminary results from fields using only water-based mud clearly indicate a reduction in environmental contamination and biological impact, compared to effects reported here, for oil-based drill-cuttings. Diversity indices applied to the data did not show the extent of effects and such indices alone should not be used to interpret changes. The consistent patterns that the multivariate techniques were able to detect showed that these methods were far superior. Analyses of the initial effects on the fauna showed that there were no consistent patterns in changes in species composition over fields or time, and thus the search for 'universal' sensitive indicator species does not seem to be rewarding. Yet under gross effects of pollution there were consistent patterns with the same species dominating.Finally, the initial effects of pollution included severe reductions in organisms that are key components of the benthic communities and also food for bottom-living fish, and are thus ecologically important.The new fauna which establishes in the contaminated sediments close to platforms, often with high abundance, will probably be less valuable as a food source for fish populations since it is of small size and lives sub-surface.},

  abstract = {On May 21st, 2011, one of Iceland's most active volcano, Grimsvo tn, started its strongest eruption in a century. Grimsvotn produced hundreds of megatonnes of fine basaltic ash, which spread over Iceland, the North Atlantic and Europe. Such fine grained ash can impact human activity and health both with fertilization and with toxicity potential for aquatic environments. The purpose of this study was: (1) to investigate the basic physical and chemical properties of the ash from the 2011 Grimsvotn eruption, (2) to identify surface salts deposited on the ash during the eruption, (3) to identify which elements are released during ash-water interactions and their release rates, (4) to characterize the secondary phases formed during water exposure, and (5) to assess impact of the ash on humans and the environment.During the eruption, we collected a unique set of pristine ash samples over a range of 50-115 km from the source and examined them with X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), surface area analysis (BET), laser absorption, electron microprobe (EMPA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The ash could be classified as glassy tholeiitic basalt with {$<$} 10 mass\% crystalline plagioclase (Al1.6Ca0.6Na0.4Si2.4O8) and pyroxene. The particles were small ({$<$} 125 mu m) and elongated with sharp edges. About 50\% of the particle mass was fine ash ({$<$} 63 mu m), which could travel long distances, and similar to 8\% was very fine ash ({$<$} 10 mu m), which is harmful if inhaled. The specific surface area of the pristine ash ranged from 0.4 to 0.7 m(2)/g. Material taken up on particle surfaces contributed the equivalent of {$<$} 0.5 nm thick layer, consisting of salts such as CaSO4, Na2SO4, NaCl, CaF2, CaCl2, MgSO4 and MgCl2.We exposed the pristine ash to ultrapure deionised (MilliQ) water in a single pass, plug, flow through reactor and the effluent was analyzed for 73 elements using inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectroscopy (ICP-SFMS) and ion chromatography (IC). High release rates of mainly S, Na, Ca, Mg, F and Cl were observed during the first 10 min but after 12 h, the most abundant element released was Si. The effluent was alkaline. Secondary phases of mainly Al and Fe precipitated on the ash surfaces and these were suspected of scavenging As, Ba, Cr, Co, Cu, Ga, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, Te, V and Zn. The maximum total of surface salts containing F, Cl and S, carried by the erupted ash, was 11, 13 and 117 kilotonne. The flux of nutrient and toxic elements from the Grimsvotn ash was low compared with that from other eruptions and would not have been expected to cause poisoning of mammals or aquatic life. The elements most likely to affect sensitive biota were F, Se, Cu and Zn. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In addition haematocrit, plasma chloride and condition factors (weight x 100/length(3)) were measured, and genetic diversity determined. A negative correlation was found between the Cd/Zn MT content and the condition factor in the different trout populations, and Naustebekken trout, having the lowest condition factor, were less heterozygous than Rugla trout, indicating that Naustebekken trout have adapted to the metal in their environment. Significant positive correlations were found between accumulated levels of Cd and Cd/Zn MT in liver and kidney, suggesting that liver and kidney, but not gill, Cd/Zn MT can be used as a biomarker for chronic Cd exposure. Cu MT seems less suitable as a biomarker for Cu exposure. These data together further emphasize that MTs must be applied with caution, when assessing these proteins in biomonitoring of the natural environment.},

Cu MT concentrations in the investigated tissues, however, were highest in trout from the river with the lowest ambient Cu concentration. It is suggested that MTs are of less importance in Cu-acclimated trout. The data also suggest that acclimation to a Cu-rich environment involves reduced Cu accumulation or increased Cu elimination. In trout from the Cd-rich environment, this metal was mainly bound to MT, whereas in trout from the Cu-rich environment Cd was also associated with non-MT proteins. These findings emphasize the importance to determine both Cd/Zn MT and Cu MT levels, when the participation of this protein in metal handling in trout tissues is investigated.

Metallothionein (MT) was also measured in these tissues. The two rivers, Rugla (Cu contaminated) and Naustebekken (Cd and Zn contaminated), are located in two neighboring drainage basins separated by the topographic divide near the city of R{\o}ros in the County of S{\o}r-Tr{\o}ndelag, Norway. In Rugla, the Cu concentration increased from 15 {\textmu}g/l at the low water level to 41 {\textmu}g/l during the run-off episode. In Naustebekken, corresponding values for Cd were 90-170 ng/l and those for Zn were 49-91 {\textmu}g/l. Gill concentrations of Cu and Cd/Zn MT in both populations of native trout clearly reflect the presence of these metals in the rivers during the run-off, in accordance with the hypothesis of protection caused by MT induction. When Rugla trout were transferred to Naustebekken and vice versa, both the amounts of MT itself and the Cu contents reflected the concentration of this metal in the new environment, indicating that MT induction also protects against acutely increased metal levels. The measured levels of MT in both native and transferred trout can account for all the Cd present in the tissues, but not for all of the Cu and Zn. The capacity of MT to regulate Cd and Cu in the trout populations in their natural habitat therefore seems clearly present. Our data also indicate that the MT I and II isoforms may bind metals selectively.},

  abstract = {Seasonal fluctuations in mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and selenium (Se) concentrations were studied in black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) from Kongsfjorden, Svalbard (79{$^\circ$}57'N, 12{$^\circ$}12'E). Element concentrations were determined in muscle and liver tissue in kittiwakes collected in May, July and October 2007. Stable isotopes of carbon ({$\delta$}(13)C) and nitrogen ({$\delta$}(15)N) were analysed in muscle tissue to calculate trophic position (TP) and examine the possible influence of carbon source on element accumulation. Metallothionein (MT) concentrations in liver, as well as Hg and Cd concentration in size-fractionated liver supernatant were determined to evaluate the association between elements and MT. Mercury concentrations declined from May through July to October in both tissues, while concentrations of Cd were similar in May and July and lower in October. A decline in TP between May and July, indicating a shift from fish-based diet towards an invertebrate-based diet explains the declining Hg concentration. The low Hg and Cd concentrations in October may be a result of an increased elimination, probably related to moulting. Selenium decreased in the same manner as Hg in liver and muscle, possibly related to the formation of Se-Hg complexes. Zinc and Cu did not fluctuate in muscle tissue, whereas hepatic Zn concentrations where highest in May. Hepatic Zn concentrations were higher in females compared to males in May, possibly related to egg production. Hepatic MT concentrations were lower in October compared to July, following the same trend as Hg and Cd. Cadmium was predominantly bound to the MT fraction of proteins in liver tissue, whereas Hg was associated with the larger proteins, indicating that MT was not sequestering Hg in the kittiwakes.},

The fractionation showed that Cd and Zn, and especially Cu and Pb, were present to a large degree (63-98\%) as particulate and colloidal matter {$>$}0.45microm. Cr, Co and Ni were on the contrary present mostly as non-labile complexes (69-79\%) {$<$}0.45microm.

Aluminium was present mainly as particulate and colloidal matter {$>$}0.45microm. The particulate and colloidal matter {$>$}0.45microm was mainly inorganic; indicating that the metals present in this fraction were bound as inorganic compounds. The fractionation gives important information on the mobility and potential bioavailability of the metals investigated, in contrast to the total metal concentrations usually reported. To study possible changes in respective metal species in leachate in aerated sedimentation tanks, freshly sampled leachate was stored for 48h, and subsequently fractionated. This showed that the free heavy metals are partly immobilized during storage of leachate with oxygen available. The largest effects were found for Cd and Zn. The proportion of As and Cr present as particulate matter or colloids {$>$}0.45microm also increased.},

Here, we studied elemental concentrations in the non-lethally collected samples from the most numerous seabird in European Arctic, the little auk (Alle alle) nesting in one breeding colony in Svalbard. This seabird spent the breeding season in the high-Arctic zone and the non-breeding period in sub-Arctic areas what may implicate spatio-temporal variation in elements bioaccumulation. We determined concentrations of 19 elements in adults feathers to determine levels of exposure during part of the pre-breeding (n~=~74) and post-breeding (n~=~74) seasons, feathers from nestlings (n~=~18) to determine local contamination, and chick down (n~=~16) and post-hatching eggshells (n~=~18) to determine maternal input to offspring. During the pre-breeding period adults accumulated in their feathers significantly more Hg (one third of feathers exceeded the established toxicity threshold), Se and Mn compared to the post-breeding period. It reflects a higher exposition of birds to contaminants in pre-breeding moult areas outside the High Arctic compared to the post-breeding moult in the High Arctic. Sex differences in adult feathers representing the post-breeding period were found only for Ca and Zn with higher values in females. Chick down was characterized by high levels of several essential elements, an intermediate level of Hg and Se, and the highest Se:Hg molar ratios of all groups. Chick body feathers had the highest level of Cu and K among all the studied groups. Post-hatching eggshells were characterized by high Sr level (exceeding 2000~{$\mu$}g/g). Concentrations of several non-essential elements (Bi, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni and Pb) in them were below method detection limits.},

  abstract = {During recent years, the biotic ligand model (BLM) has been proposed as a tool to evaluate quantitatively the manner in which water chemistry affects the speciation and biological availability of metals in aquatic systems. This is an important consideration because it is the bioavailability and bioreactivity of metals that control their potential to cause adverse effects. The BLM approach has gained widespread interest amongst the scientific, regulated and regulatory communities because of its potential for use in developing water quality criteria (WQC) and in performing aquatic risk assessments for metals. Specifically, the BLM does this in a way that considers the important influences of site-specific water quality. This journal issue includes papers that describe recent advances with regard to the development of the BLM approach. Here, the current status of the BLM development effort is described in the context of the longer-term history of advances in the understanding of metal interactions in the environment upon which the BLM is based. Early developments in the aquatic chemistry of metals, the physiology of aquatic organisms and aquatic toxicology are reviewed first, and the degree to which each of these disciplines influenced the development of water quality regulations is discussed. The early scientific advances that took place in each of these fields were not well coordinated, making it difficult for regulatory authorities to take full advantage of the potential utility of what had been learned. However, this has now changed, with the BLM serving as a useful interface amongst these scientific disciplines, and within the regulatory arena as well. The more recent events that have led to the present situation are reviewed, and consideration is given to some of the future needs and developments related to the BLM that are envisioned. The research results that are described in the papers found in this journal issue represent a distinct milestone in the ongoing evolution of the BLM approach and, more generally, of approaches to performing ecological assessments for metals in aquatic systems. These papers also establish a benchmark to which future scientific and regulatory developments can be compared. Finally, they demonstrate the importance and usefulness of the concept of bioavailability and of evaluative tools such as the BLM.},

  abstract = {One application of nanocopper is as a wood-preserving pesticide in pressure-treated lumber. Recent research has shown that pressure-treated lumber amended with micronized copper azole (MCA), which contains nanosized copper, releases copper under estuarine and marine conditions. The form of copper released (i.e., ionic, nanocopper [1-100\,nm in size]) is not fully understood but will affect the bioavailability and toxicity of the metal. In the present study, multiple lines of evidence, including size fractionation, ion-selective electrode electrochemistry, comparative toxicity, and copper speciation were used to determine the form of copper released from lumber blocks and sawdust. The results of all lines of evidence supported the hypothesis that ionic copper was released from MCA lumber and sawdust, with little evidence that nanocopper was released. For example, copper concentrations in size fractionations of lumber block aqueous leachates including unfiltered, 0.1\,{$\mu$}m, and 3\,kDa were not significantly different, suggesting that the form of copper released was in the size range operationally defined as dissolved. These results correlated with the ion-selective electrode data which detects only ionic copper. In addition, comparative toxicity testing resulted in a narrow range of median lethal concentrations (221-257\,{$\mu$}g/L) for MCA lumber blocks and CuSO(4) . We conclude that ionic copper was released from the nanocopper pressure-treated lumber under estuarine and marine conditions. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:1969-1979.

As this area suffered a long-lasting contamination due to both organic and inorganic contaminants, a series of restoration activities were activated to tackle and to prevent potential risks for ecosystem and local population. Our results demonstrated that the levels of TEs accumulated in edible tissues of transplanted mussels in the Flekkefjord fjord were generally low before the beginning of the restoration activities. However, location- and time-specific differences in the~accumulation of TEs were noted after the implementation of such activities. Interestingly, the levels of Fe and Mn significantly increased after the beginning of the restoration activities, likely because the release of these TEs from the~slag used in such operations and/or resuspension of contaminated sediments. However, assuming that native mussels can accumulate the same TEs at levels measured in transplanted individuals, our results suggest a substantial safety for human consumption of native mussels from the Flekkefjord fjord, regardless of restoration activities.},

In this study the influence of variables known to affect metal mobility and availability (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pH, salinity, temperature, aerated/anoxic conditions) along with variables affected by the discharge conditions (flocculant concentration, suspension) were studied in bench-scale experiments. The leaching tests were developed based on the case of a copper mine by Repparfjorden, northern Norway, which is planned to re-open in 2022. The experiments, which had three week duration, revealed low ({$<$}6~\%) leaching of metals. Multivariate analysis showed that all variables, apart from DOC, highly influenced leaching and partitioning of at least one metal (Ba, Cr, Cu, and/or Mn). The high quantity of the planned annual discharge of mine tailings to the fjord (1-2~million~tonnes) warranted estimation of the leached quantity of metals. Multivariate models, using present-day conditions in the fjord, estimated leaching of up to 124~kg Ba, 154~kg Cu and 2400~kg Mn per year during discharge of tailings. Future changes in the fjord conditions caused by climate change (decreased pH, increased temperature) was predicted by the multivariate models to increase the leaching up to 55~\%, by the year 2065. The bench-scale experiments demonstrated the importance of including relevant variables (such as pH, salinity, and temperature) for metal leaching and -partitioning in leaching tests. The results showed that metal leaching during discharge is expected and will increase in the future due to the changed conditions caused by the foreseen climate change, and thereby underline the importance of monitoring metal concentrations in water during operations to determine the fate of metals in the fjord.},

Metal speciation analysis was used to assess the historical dispersion of metals as well as their potential bioavailability from the area of the mine tailing disposal. It was revealed that the dispersion of Ba, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn from the mine tailings has been limited. Dispersion of Cu to the outer fjord has, however, occurred; the amounts released and dispersed from the mine tailing disposal area quantified to be 2.5-10t, less than 5\% of Cu in the original mine tailings. An estimated 80-390t of Cu still remains in the disposal area from the surface to a depth of 16cm. Metal partitioning showed that 56-95\% of the Cu is bound in the potential bioavailable fractions (exchangeable, reducible and oxidisable) of the sediments, totalling approximately 70-340t, with potential for continuous release to the pore water and re-precipitation in over- and underlying sediments. Surface sediments in the deposit area were affected by elevated Cu concentrations just above the probable effect level according to the Norwegian sediment quality criteria, with 50-80\% Cu bound in the exchangeable, reducible and oxidisable fractions, potentially available for release to the water column and/or for uptake in benthic organisms.},

  abstract = {Background The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) are developing joint estimates of the work-related burden of disease and injury (WHO/ILO Joint Estimates). For this, systematic reviews of studies estimating the prevalence of exposure to selected occupational risk factors will be conducted to provide input data for estimations of the number of exposed workers. A critical part of systematic review methods is to assess risk of bias (RoB) of individual studies. In this article, we present and describe the development of such a tool, called the Risk of Bias in Studies estimating Prevalence of Exposure to Occupational risk factors (RoB-SPEO) tool; report results from RoB-SPEO's pilot testing; note RoB-SPEO's limitations; and suggest how the tool might be tested and developed further. Methods Selected existing RoB tools used in environmental and occupational health systematic reviews were reviewed and analysed. From existing tools, we identified domains for the new tool and, if necessary, added new domains. For each domain, we then identified and integrated components from the existing tools (i.e. instructions, domains, guiding questions, considerations, ratings and rating criteria), and, if necessary, we developed new components. Finally, we elicited feedback from other systematic review methodologists and exposure scientists and agreed upon RoB-SPEO. Nine experts pilot tested RoB-SPEO, and we calculated a raw measure of inter-rater agreement (Pi) for each of its domain, rating Pi\,{$<$}\,0.4 as poor, 0.4\,{$\leq$}\,Pi\,{$\geq$}\,0.8 as substantial and Pi\,{$>$}\,0.80 as almost perfect agreement. Results Our review found no standard tool for assessing RoB in prevalence studies of exposure to occupational risk factors. We identified six existing tools for environmental and occupational health systematic reviews and found that their components for assessing RoB differ considerably. With the new RoB-SPEO tool, assessors judge RoB for each of eight domains: (1) bias in selection of participants into the study; (2) bias due to a lack of blinding of study personnel; (3) bias due to exposure misclassification; (4) bias due to incomplete exposure data; (5) bias due to conflict of interest; (6) bias due to selective reporting of exposures; (7) bias due to difference in numerator and denominator; and (8) other bias. The RoB-SPEO's ratings are low, probably low, probably high, high or no information. Pilot testing of the RoB-SPEO tool found substantial inter-rater agreement for six domains (range of Pi for these domains: 0.51--0.80), but poor agreement for two domains (i.e. Pi of 0.31 and 0.33 for biases due to incomplete exposure data and in selection of participants into the study, respectively). Limitations of RoB-SPEO include that it has not yet been fully performance-tested. Conclusions We developed the RoB-SPEO tool for assessing RoB in prevalence studies of exposure to occupational risk factors. The tool will be applied and its performance tested in the ongoing systematic reviews for the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates.},

  abstract = {Alum shale formations in Scandinavia are generally enriched in uranium (U) and, when exposed to air and water, may produce acidic rock drainage (ARD), releasing potentially harmful elements into the environment. Taraldrud is a legacy site in southeast Norway where approx. 51\,000 m(3) of alum shale was deposited in the 1980s-1990s. In 2006, ARD formation became obvious after high concentrations of leachable elements and low environmental pH were measured in a nearby stream. A manmade precipitation pond and liming treatments attempt to address the environmental pollution, but the site remains non-remediated. This study aimed to evaluate the extent of contamination caused by ARD and examine environmental and human health risks caused by mobilized trace elements and radionuclides. Surface water, sediment, soil, and biota samples were collected in the area and chemically and/or radiochemically analyzed to assess the prevailing concentrations within different environmental compartments. The elemental distribution and variation patterns were studied using principal component analysis. Most of the leachable elements were present in highly mobile and bioavailable forms in the pond water, out of which Cd, Mn, Ni, and U exceeded drinking water regulations. The highest enrichment in soil and sediment was for U, which was associated with the sulfide-bearing soil fraction, Fe, Cu, Mo, and As. No changes in water quality were observed between up- and downstream from the site, indicating that the Fe and S rich phases in the pond retain the leachable elements effectively under prevailing environmental conditions. This study provides valuable insights into the risks and challenges associated with ARD and where U is the main pollutant of concern.},

The investigation aimed at revealing differences in the accumulation pattern of heavy metals in mussels inhabiting sediments characterized by varying metal bioavailability. The contents of metals adsorbed to sediments and associated with iron and manganese hydroxides, which were obtained by sequential extraction, were utilized as a measure of metal bioavailability. The contents of Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu and Cr in mussels collected off Spitsbergen were generally lower than those in mussels from the Baltic Sea. In sediments collected off Spitsbergen the bioavailable fraction represented a small proportion (0-3.7\% adsorbed metals and 0-11\% associated with metals hydroxides) of total heavy metal contents. In sediments from the Baltic Sea the percentages of metals adsorbed and bound to hydroxides were 1-46\% and 1-13\%, respectively. The differences in bioavailable metal contents measured in sediments were utilized to explain the different contents of metals in mussels collected in the corresponding sites.},

  abstract = {Fundamental physico-chemical properties of trace metals and organochlorines are important in defining their toxicities, cycling and fates in aquatic ecosystems. A broad overview is presented of the chemistries and bioaccumulation of trace metals and organochlorines in aquatic environments, illustrating this concept. The importance of the free ion is emphasized in defining the accumulation and toxicological effects of certain trace metals. However, the uptake of some elements may depend on factors other than the presence of the free metal ion, including the existence of alkylated species or of other particular chemical forms. It is suggested that a variety of mechanisms have evolved to deal with the potential impacts of trace elements and that the organism itself is thus of great importance in defining metal uptake and excretion. By contrast, organochlorines are accumulated by biota in simple response to physico-chemical processes, and organism physiology is generally unimportant in this. The partitioning of organochlorines into lipids is considered to be the most important uptake mechanism, and to underlie most of the observed impacts of extraneous factors on the bioaccumulation of organochlorines. The importance of highly refractory organic contaminants is emphasized, particularly through reference to the non-ortho coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The need is highlighted for further studies of environmental media to ascertain temporal fluctuations in the levels of non-ortho coplanar PCBs. Fundamental research into chemical analytical techniques is also noted to be required, such that the numbers and range of trace contaminants which are identified in aquatic monitoring programmes may be extended.},

  abstract = {Exposure to humidifier disinfectants has been linked to respiratory diseases, including interstitial lung disease, asthma, and pneumonia. Consequently, numerous toxicological studies have explored respiratory damage as both a necessary and sufficient condition for these diseases. We systematically reviewed and integrated evidence from toxicological studies by applying the evidence integration method established in previous research to confirm the biological plausibility of the association between exposure and disease. We conducted a literature search focusing on polyhexamethylene guanidine phosphate (PHMG) and chloromethylisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone (CMIT/MIT), the primary ingredients in humidifier disinfectants. We selected relevant studies based on their quality and the population, exposure, comparator, outcome (PECO) statements. These studies were categorized into three lines of evidence: hazard information, animal studies, and mechanistic studies. Based on a systematic review, we integrated the evidence to develop an aggregate exposure pathway-adverse outcome pathway (AEP-AOP) model for respiratory damage. The reliability and relevance of our findings were assessed by comparing them with the hypothesized pathogenic mechanisms of respiratory diseases. By integrating toxicological evidence for each component of the AEP-AOP framework for PHMG and CMIT/MIT, we developed an AEP-AOP model that elucidates how disinfectants released from humidifiers expose target sites, triggering molecular initiating events and key events that ultimately lead to respiratory damage. This model exhibits high reliability and relevance to the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases. The AEP-AOP model developed in this study provides strong evidence, based on evidence-based toxicology, that exposure to humidifier disinfectants causes respiratory diseases. This model demonstrates the pathways leading to respiratory damage, a hallmark of these conditions.},

While the exposome concept has been established for human health, its principles can be extended to include broader ecological issues. The assessment of exposure is tightly interlinked with hazard assessment. Here, we explore if mechanistic understanding of the causal links between exposure and adverse effects on human health and the environment can be improved by integrating the exposome approach with the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) concept that structures and organizes the sequence of biological events from an initial molecular interaction of a chemical with a biological target to an adverse outcome. Complementing exposome research with the AOP concept may facilitate a mechanistic understanding of stress-induced adverse effects, examine the relative contributions from various components of the exposome, determine the primary risk drivers in complex mixtures, and promote an integrative assessment of chemical risks for both human and environmental health.},

The purpose of the workshop was to review the specific roles that high-content omics datasets (eg, transcriptomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics) can hold within the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework for supporting ecological and human health risk assessments. In light of the growing number of examples of the application of omics data in the context of ecological risk assessment, we considered how omics datasets might continue to support the AOP framework. In particular, the role of omics in identifying potential AOP molecular initiating events and providing supportive evidence of key events at different levels of biological organization and across taxonomic groups was discussed. Areas with potential for short and medium-term breakthroughs were also discussed, such as providing mechanistic evidence to support chemical read-across, providing weight of evidence information for mode of action assignment, understanding biological networks, and developing robust extrapolations of species-sensitivity. Key challenges that need to be addressed were considered, including the need for a cohesive approach towards experimental design, the lack of a mutually agreed framework to quantitatively link genes and pathways to key events, and the need for better interpretation of chemically induced changes at the molecular level. This article was developed to provide an overview of ecological risk assessment process and a perspective on how high content molecular-level datasets can support the future of assessment procedures through the AOP framework.},

Generally, methodologies to address mixtures have been agreed; however, there are still several data and methodological gaps to be addressed. New approach methodologies can support the filling of knowledge gaps on the toxicity and mode(s) of action of individual chemicals. (Bio)Monitoring, modeling, and better data sharing will support the derivation of more realistic co-exposure scenarios. As knowledge and data gaps often hamper an in-depth assessment of specific chemical mixtures, the option of taking account of possible mixture effects in single substance risk assessments is briefly discussed. To allow risk managers to take informed decisions, transparent documentation of assumptions and related uncertainties is recommended indicating the potential impact on the assessment. Considering the large number of possible combinations of chemicals in mixtures, prioritization is needed, so that actions first address mixtures of highest concern and chemicals that drive the mixture risk. As chemicals with different applications and regulated separately might lead to similar toxicological effects, it is important to consider chemical mixtures across legislative sectors.},

In this study, to integrate exposure and toxicity pathways of MNPs, a comprehensive review of the occurrence, toxicokinetics (absorption, distribution, and excretion [ADE]), and toxicity of MNPs were investigated using the aggregate exposure pathway (AEP) and adverse outcome pathway (AOP) frameworks. Eighty-five papers were selected: 34 papers were on detecting MNPs in environmental samples, 38 papers were on the ADE of MNPs in humans and fish, and 36 papers were related to MNPs toxicity using experimental models. This review not only summarizes individual studies but also presents a preliminary AEP-AOP framework. This framework offers a comprehensive overview of pathways, enabling a clearer visualization of intricate processes spanning from environmental media, absorption, distribution, and molecular effects to adverse outcomes. Overall, this review emphasizes the importance of integrating exposure and toxicity pathways of MNPs by utilizing AEP-AOP to comprehensively understand their impacts on human and ecological organisms.

High concerns on the risks of microplastic pollution to humans and ecosystems have therefore been raised in the past decade. While a large number of studies have been conducted to investigate the environmental levels and toxicity of microplastics, the information generated to support risk assessment is fragmented and the coherence between different types of study is largely lacking. Here we introduced the Aggregate Exposure Pathway (AEP), a conceptual framework originally proposed for chemical exposure assessment, to facilitate organization, visualization and evaluation of existing information generated from microplastic research, and to efficiently identify future knowledge and regulatory needs. A putative microplastic AEP network (mpAEP) was developed to demonstrate the concept and model development strategies. Two mpAEP case studies, with polyethylene (PE) as a prototype, were then presented based on existing environmental exposure data collected from the Changjiang Estuary and the East China Sea (Case I), and the Oslo Fjord (Case II), respectively. Weight of evidence (WoE) assessment of the mpAEPs were performed for evaluating the essentiality, theoretical plausibility, empirical evidence and quantitative understanding of the evidence and relationships in the AEPs. Both cases showed moderate/high WoE to support the strength of the models, whereas also displayed clear knowledge gaps, thus providing guidance for future investigations and regulations. The mpAEP framework introduced herein presents a novel strategy for organizing fragmented information from diverse types of microplastic research, enhancing mechanistic understanding of causal relationships and facilitating the development of quantitative prediction models for research and regulation in the future.},

AOP development for engineered nanomaterials (ENM), including silver nanoparticles (AgNP), is currently lagging behind other chemicals of regulatory interest due to our limited understanding of the mechanism by which underlying genetics or diseases directly modify host response to AgNP exposures. This also highlights the importance of considering the Aggregate Exposure Pathway (AEP) framework, which precedes the AOP framework and outlines source to target site exposure. The AEP and AOP frameworks interface at the target site, where a molecular initiating event (MIE) occurs and is followed by key events (KE) for adverse cellular and organ responses along a biological pathway and ends with the adverse organism response. The primary goal of this study is to use AgNP to interrogate the AEP-AOP framework by organizing and integrating in vitro dose-response data and in vivo exposure-response data from previous studies to evaluate the effects of interactions between host genetic and acquired factors, or gene {\texttimes} environment interactions (G\,{\texttimes}\,E), on AgNP toxicity in the respiratory system. Using this framework will help us to identify plausible key event relationships (KER) between MIE and adverse organism responses when KE are not measured using the same assay in order to derive future predictive models, guide research, and support development of tools for making risk-based, regulatory decisions on ENM.

Novel approaches exploring how to implement Systematic Review (SR) principles and methods for evaluating human health risks from environmental chemical exposures are needed. This paper reports and comments on a conceptual model that was developed as part of a mapping exercise for planning a SR, using aluminium-containing antiperspirants (Al-AP) and female breast cancer risk as a case study. The work explores how knowledge-assembly tools and pathway-oriented thinking developed in systems toxicology can be applied to support problem formulation (PF) in the context of SR. A conceptual model was developed to map out key research questions, working hypotheses, routes of exposure, toxicity pathways and endpoints, and related health outcomes. The model draws on the analytic framework for screening topics of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and builds on the concept of a "source-to-outcome continuum", integrating knowledge gained from exposure pathway concepts such as the Aggregate Exposure Pathway and Adverse Outcome Pathways. The model can be used as a central decision and prioritization tool for scoping and framing Population, Exposure, Control, Outcome (PECO) questions in a transparent and iterative manner; as a supporting tool to guide the whole SR process; and to lay down the methodological foundation of a SR on the Al-AP breast cancer topic. Logic modelling can be easily combined with systems or pathway-oriented thinking, and allows for a more structured, objective and transparent approach to PF when applying SR methods to the CRA context.},

  abstract = {In silico toxicology is an emerging field. It gains increasing importance as research is aiming to decrease the use of animal experiments as suggested in the 3R principles by Russell and Burch. In silico toxicology is a means to identify hazards of compounds before synthesis, and thus in very early stages of drug development. For chemical industries, as well as regulatory agencies it can aid in gap-filling and guide risk minimization strategies. Techniques such as structural alerts, read-across, quantitative structure-activity relationship, machine learning, and deep learning allow to use in silico toxicology in many cases, some even when data is scarce. Especially the concept of adverse outcome pathways puts all techniques into a broader context and can elucidate predictions by mechanistic insights.

  abstract = {Advancements in measurement and modeling capabilities are providing unprecedented access to estimates of chemical exposure and bioactivity. With this influx of new data, there is a need for frameworks that help organize and disseminate information on chemical hazard and exposure in a manner that is accessible and transparent. A case study approach was used to demonstrate integration of the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) and Aggregate Exposure Pathway (AEP) frameworks to support cumulative risk assessment of co-exposure to two phthalate esters that are ubiquitous in the environment and that are associated with disruption of male sexual development in the rat: di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP). A putative AOP was developed to guide selection of an in vitro assay for derivation of bioactivity values for DEHP and DnBP and their metabolites. AEPs for DEHP and DnBP were used to extract key exposure data as inputs for a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to predict internal metabolite concentrations. These metabolite concentrations were then combined using in vitro-based relative potency factors for comparison with an internal dose metric, resulting in an estimated margin of safety of  13,000. This case study provides an adaptable workflow for integrating exposure and toxicity data by coupling AEP and AOP frameworks and using in vitro and in silico methodologies for cumulative risk assessment.},

  abstract = {The remarkable advances coming about through nanotechnology promise to revolutionize many aspects of modern life; however, these advances come with a responsibility for due diligence to ensure that they are not accompanied by adverse consequences for human health or the environment. Many novel nanomaterials (having at least one dimension {\textexclamdown}100 nm) could be highly mobile if released into the environment and are also very reactive, which has raised concerns for potential adverse impacts including, among others, the potential for neurotoxicity. Several lines of evidence led to concerns for neurotoxicity, but perhaps none more than observations that inhaled nanoparticles impinging on the mucosal surface of the nasal epithelium could be internalized into olfactory receptor neurons and transported by axoplasmic transport into the olfactory bulbs without crossing the blood-brain barrier. From the olfactory bulb, there is concern that nanomaterials may be transported deeper into the brain and affect other brain structures. Of course, people will not be exposed to only engineered nanomaterials, but rather such exposures will occur in a complex mixture of environmental materials, some of which are incidentally generated particles of a similar inhalable size range to engineered nanomaterials. To date, most experimental studies of potential neurotoxicity of nanomaterials have not considered the potential exposure sources and pathways that could lead to exposure, and most studies of nanomaterial exposure have not considered potential neurotoxicity. Here, we present a review of potential sources of exposures to nanoparticles, along with a review of the literature on potential neurotoxicity of nanomaterials. We employ the linked concepts of an aggregate exposure pathway (AEP) and an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) to organize and present the material. The AEP includes a sequence of key events progressing from material sources, release to environmental media, external exposure, internal exposure, and distribution to the target site. The AOP begins with toxicant at the target site causing a molecular initiating event and, like the AEP, progress sequentially to actions at the level of the cell, organ, individual, and population. Reports of nanomaterial actions are described at every key event along the AEP and AOP, except for changes in exposed populations that have not yet been observed. At this last stage, however, there is ample evidence of population level effects from exposure to ambient air particles that may act similarly to engineered nanomaterials. The data give an overall impression that current exposure levels may be considerably lower than those reported experimentally to be neurotoxic. This impression, however, is tempered by the absence of long-term exposure studies with realistic routes and levels of exposure to address concerns for chronic accumulation of materials or damage. Further, missing across the board are "key event relationships", which are quantitative expressions linking the key events of either the AEP or the AOP, making it impossible to quantitatively project the likelihood of adverse neurotoxic effects from exposure to nanomaterials or to estimate margins of exposure for such relationships.},

The framework is designed to support the assessment of risks from combined chemical exposures. The framework covers interactions between chemicals that occur over the entire source-to-outcome continuum including interactions that are studied in the fields of chemical transport, environmental fate, exposure assessment, dosimetry, and individual and population-based adverse outcomes. The framework proposes to organize data using a semantic triple of a chemical (subject), has impact (predicate), and a causal event on the source-to-outcome continuum of a second chemical (object). The location of the causal event on the source-to-outcome continuum and the nature of the impact are used as the basis for a taxonomy of interactions. The approach also builds on concepts from the Aggregate Exposure Pathway (AEP) and Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP). The framework proposes the linking of AEPs of multiple chemicals and the AOP networks relevant to those chemicals to form AEP-AOP networks that describe chemical interactions that cannot be characterized using AOP networks alone. Such AEP-AOP networks will aid the construction of workflows for both experimental design and the systematic review or evaluation performed in risk assessments. Finally, the framework is used to link the constructs of existing component-based approaches for mixture toxicology to specific categories in the interaction taxonomy.},

The Aggregate Exposure Pathway (AEP) and Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) frameworks can mechanistically inform cumulative risk assessment for human health and ecological end points by linking together environmental transport and transformation, external exposure, toxicokinetics, and toxicodynamics. This work presents a case study of a hypothetical contaminated site to demonstrate a quantitative approach for implementing the AEP framework and linking this framework to AOPs. We construct an AEP transport and transformation model and then quantify external exposure pathways for humans, fishes, and small herbivorous mammals at the hypothetical site. A Monte Carlo approach was used to address parameter variability. Source apportionment was quantified for each species, and published pharmacokinetic models were used to estimate internal target site exposure from external exposures. Published dose-response data for a multispecies AOP network were used to interpret AEP results in the context of species-specific effects. This work demonstrates (1) the construction, analysis, and application of a quantitative AEP model, (2) the utility of AEPs for organizing mechanistic exposure data and highlighting data gaps, and (3) the advantages provided by a source-to-outcome construct for leveraging exposure data and to aid transparency regarding assumptions.},

  abstract = {An Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) is a conceptual construct that describes existing knowledge on the link between a molecular initiating event and an adverse outcome. A sequential chain of causally related events is portrayed at different levels of biological organisation. AOPs are considered to be useful mechanistic blueprints for the development of novel tools for human and environmental risk assessment. Following OECD guidance, an increasing number of AOPs for chemically-induced adverse effects in humans and environmental species are being proposed. Due to their unique properties, the toxicity of nanomaterials (NMs) and chemicals is often difficult to directly compare since their mechanisms usually differ. While there are still many knowledge gaps in our understanding of NM toxicity, an ever increasing number of mechanistic studies are shedding light on their toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic properties. In this paper, we introduce the concept of AOPs and analyse its possible implementation for nanotoxicology. We illustrate how the AOP framework can be used to rationally combine mechanistic knowledge relating to both NM- and chemically-induced liver toxicity to fill information gaps and guide the development of toxicity testing strategies. The differences between NM and chemically-induced adversity are proposed to be primarily related to differences in toxicokinetics and the nature of the initial Key Events in the AOP. Consequently, much of the mechanistic knowledge captured by AOPs that have been developed from consideration of chemically-induced toxicity is also relevant to describe AOPs applicable to NMs, at least in qualitative terms, and thus can be used to inform predictive modelling and risk assessment of NM toxicity.},

Such a source-to-effect continuum is advocated to balance the complexity of human exposure and the insufficiency of relevant data for thousands of existing and emerging chemicals. Here, we introduce the Risk Assessment, IDentification And Ranking-Indoor and Consumer Exposure (RAIDAR-ICE) model, which establishes an integrated framework to evaluate human exposure due to indoor use and direct application of chemicals to humans. As a model evaluation, RAIDAR-ICE faithfully reproduces exposure estimates inferred from biomonitoring data for 37 chemicals with direct and indirect near-field sources. RAIDAR-ICE generates different rankings for 131 chemicals based on different exposure- and risk-based assessment metrics, demonstrating its versatility for diverse chemical screening goals. When coupled with a far-field RAIDAR model, the near-field RAIDAR-ICE model enables assessment of aggregate human exposure. Overall, RAIDAR-ICE is a powerful tool for high-throughput screening and prioritization of human exposure to neutral organic chemicals used indoors.},

These approaches will be based on mechanisms of toxicity, an understanding of dosimetry, and the use of in silico modeling and in vitro test methods. In order to accelerate wider implementation of such approaches, development of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) can help identify and address gaps in our understanding of relevant parameters for model input and mechanisms, and optimize non-animal approaches that can be used to investigate key events of toxicity. This paper describes the AOPs and the toolbox of in vitro and in silico models that can be used to assess the key events leading to toxicity following inhalation exposure. Because the optimal testing strategy will vary depending on the substance of interest, here we present a decision tree approach to identify an appropriate non-animal integrated testing strategy that incorporates consideration of a substance's physicochemical properties, relevant mechanisms of toxicity, and available in silico models and in vitro test methods. This decision tree can facilitate standardization of the testing approaches. Case study examples are presented to provide a basis for proof-of-concept testing to illustrate the utility of non-animal approaches to inform hazard identification and risk assessment of humans exposed to inhaled substances.},

Just as the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework has emerged as a means of providing insight into mechanism-based toxicity, the exposure science community has seen the recent introduction of the Aggregate Exposure Pathway (AEP) framework. AEPs aid in making exposure data applicable to the FAIR (i.e., findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principle, especially by (1) organizing continuous flow of disjointed exposure information; (2) identifying data gaps, to focus resources on acquiring the most relevant data; (3) optimizing use and repurposing of existing exposure data; and (4) facilitating interoperability among predictive models.

In the context of EFSA's risk assessments, the problem formulation step defines the chemicals to be assessed in the terms of reference usually through regulatory criteria often set by risk managers based on legislative requirements. Scientific criteria such as hazard-driven criteria can be used to group these chemicals into assessment groups. In this guidance document, a framework is proposed to apply hazard-driven criteria for grouping of chemicals into assessment groups using mechanistic information on toxicity as the gold standard where available (i.e. common mode of action or adverse outcome pathway) through a structured weight of evidence approach. However, when such mechanistic data are not available, grouping may be performed using a common adverse outcome. Toxicokinetic data can also be useful for grouping, particularly when metabolism information is available for a class of compounds and common toxicologically relevant metabolites are shared. In addition, prioritisation methods provide means to identify low-priority chemicals and reduce the number of chemicals in an assessment group. Prioritisation methods include combined risk-based approaches, risk-based approaches for single chemicals and exposure-driven approaches. Case studies have been provided to illustrate the practical application of hazard-driven criteria and the use of prioritisation methods for grouping of chemicals in assessment groups.

A workshop held in May 2016 followed introduction of the AEP concept, allowing members of the exposure science community to provide extensive evaluation and feedback regarding the framework's structure, key components, and applications. The current work briefly introduces topics discussed at the workshop and attempts to address key challenges involved in refining this framework.

  abstract = {Chemical toxicity testing is moving steadily toward a human cell and organoid-based in vitro approach for reasons including scientific relevancy, efficiency, cost, and ethical rightfulness. Inferring human health risk from chemical exposure based on in vitro testing data is a challenging task, facing various data gaps along the way. This review identifies these gaps and makes a case for the in silico approach of computational dose-response and extrapolation modeling to address many of the challenges. Mathematical models that can mechanistically describe chemical toxicokinetics (TK) and toxicodynamics (TD), for both in vitro and in vivo conditions, are the founding pieces in this regard. Identifying toxicity pathways and in vitro point of departure (PoD) associated with adverse health outcomes requires an understanding of the molecular key events in the interacting transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome. Such an understanding will in turn help determine the sets of sensitive biomarkers to be measured in vitro and the scope of toxicity pathways to be modelled in silico. In vitro data reporting both pathway perturbation and chemical biokinetics in the culture medium serve to calibrate the toxicity pathway and virtual tissue models, which can then help predict PoDs in response to chemical dosimetry experienced by cells in vivo. Two types of in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) are needed. (1) For toxic effects involving systemic regulations, such as endocrine disruption, organism-level adverse outcome pathway (AOP) models are needed to extrapolate in vitro toxicity pathway perturbation to in vivo PoD. (2) Physiological-based toxicokinetic (PBTK) modeling is needed to extrapolate in vitro PoD dose metrics into external doses for expected exposure scenarios. Linked PBTK and TD models can explore the parameter space to recapitulate human population variability in response to chemical insults. While challenges remain for applying these modeling tools to support in vitro toxicity testing, they open the door toward population-stratified and personalized risk assessment.},

  abstract = {Cumulative risk assessment (CRA) methods promote the use of a conceptual site model (CSM) to apportion exposures and integrate risk from multiple stressors. While CSMs may encompass multiple species, evaluating end points across taxa can be challenging due to data availability and physiological differences among organisms. Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) describe biological mechanisms leading to adverse outcomes (AOs) by assembling causal pathways with measurable intermediate steps termed key events (KEs), thereby providing a framework for integrating data across species. In this work, we used a case study focused on the perchlorate anion (ClO4-) to highlight the value of the AOP framework for cross-species data integration. Computational models and dose-response data were used to evaluate the effects of ClO4- in 12 species and revealed a dose-response concordance across KEs and taxa. The aggregate exposure pathway (AEP) tracks stressors from sources to the exposures and serves as a complement to the AOP. We discuss how the combined AEP-AOP construct helps to maximize the use of existing data and advances CRA by (1) organizing toxicity and exposure data, (2) providing a mechanistic framework of KEs for integrating data across human health and ecological end points, (3) facilitating cross-species dose-response evaluation, and (4) highlighting data gaps and technical limitations.},

The scaffold and workflow components enhance the utility and repurposing of data with the flexibility to support regulatory decision-making in a fit-for-purpose fashion.

  abstract = {Complementing the human genome with an exposome reflects the increasingly obvious impact of environmental exposure, which far exceeds the role of genetics, on human health. Considering the complexity of exposures and, in addition, the reactions of the body to exposures - i.e., the exposome - reverses classical exposure science where the precise measurement of single or few exposures is associated with specific health or environmental effects. The complete description of an individual's exposome is impossible; even less so is that of a population. We can, however, cast a wider net by foregoing some rigor in assessment and compensating with the statistical power of rich datasets. The advent of omics technologies enables a relatively cheap, high-content description of the biological effects of substances, especially in tissues and biofluids. They can be combined with many other rich data-streams, creating big data of exposure and effect. Computational methods increasingly allow data integration, discerning the signal from the noise and formulating hypotheses of exposure-effect relationships. These can be followed up in a targeted way. With a better exposure element in the risk equation, exposomics - new kid on the block of risk assessment - promises to identify novel exposure (interactions) and health/environment effect associations. This may also create opportunities to prioritize the more relevant chemicals for risk assessment, thereby lowering the burden on hazard assessment in an expo-sure-driven approach. Technological developments and synergies between approaches, quality assurance (ultimately as Good Exposome Practices), and the integration of mechanistic thinking will advance this approach.},

Deployment of an organizational and predictive framework for exposure science analogous to the "systems approaches" used in the biological sciences is a necessary step in this evolution. Here we propose the aggregate exposure pathway (AEP) concept as the natural and complementary companion in the exposure sciences to the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) concept in the toxicological sciences. Aggregate exposure pathways offer an intuitive framework to organize exposure data within individual units of prediction common to the field, setting the stage for exposure forecasting. Looking farther ahead, we envision direct linkages between aggregate exposure pathways and adverse outcome pathways, completing the source to outcome continuum for more meaningful integration of exposure assessment and hazard identification. Together, the two frameworks form and inform a decision-making framework with the flexibility for risk-based, hazard-based, or exposure-based decision making.},

  abstract = {While human regulatory risk assessment (RA) still largely relies on animal studies, new approach methodologies (NAMs) based on in vitro, in silico or non-mammalian alternative models are increasingly used to evaluate chemical hazards. Moreover, human epidemiological studies with biomarkers of effect (BoE) also play an invaluable role in identifying health effects associated with chemical exposures. To move towards the next generation risk assessment (NGRA), it is therefore crucial to establish bridges between NAMs and standard approaches, and to establish processes for increasing mechanistically-based biological plausibility in human studies. The Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework constitutes an important tool to address these needs but, despite a significant increase in knowledge and awareness, the use of AOPs in chemical RA remains limited. The objective of this paper is to address issues related to using AOPs in a regulatory context from various perspectives as it was discussed in a workshop organized within the European Union partnerships HBM4EU and PARC in spring 2022. The paper presents examples where the AOP framework has been proven useful for the human RA process, particularly in hazard prioritization and characterization, in integrated approaches to testing and assessment (IATA), and in the identification and validation of BoE in epidemiological studies. Nevertheless, several limitations were identified that hinder the optimal usability and acceptance of AOPs by the regulatory community including the lack of quantitative information on response-response relationships and of efficient ways to map chemical data (exposure and toxicity) onto AOPs. The paper summarizes suggestions, ongoing initiatives and third-party tools that may help to overcome these obstacles and thus assure better implementation of AOPs in the NGRA.},

  abstract = {The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal agencies face a number of challenges in interpreting and reconciling short-duration (seconds to minutes) readings from mobile and handheld air sensors with the longer duration averages (hours to days) associated with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for the criteria pollutants-particulate matter (PM), ozone, carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides. Similar issues are equally relevant to the hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) where chemical-specific health effect reference values are the best indicators of exposure limits; values which are often based on a lifetime of continuous exposure. A multi-agency, staff-level Air Sensors Health Group (ASHG) was convened in 2013. ASHG represents a multi-institutional collaboration of Federal agencies devoted to discovery and discussion of sensor technologies, interpretation of sensor data, defining the state of sensor-related science across each institution, and provides consultation on how sensors might effectively be used to meet a wide range of research and decision support needs. ASHG focuses on several fronts: improving the understanding of what hand-held sensor technologies may be able to deliver; communicating what hand-held sensor readings can provide to a number of audiences; the challenges of how to integrate data generated by multiple entities using new and unproven technologies; and defining best practices in communicating health-related messages to various audiences. This review summarizes the challenges, successes, and promising tools of those initial ASHG efforts and Federal agency progress on crafting similar products for use with other NAAQS pollutants and the HAPs.

  abstract = {Bees are essential pollinators of many crops and wild plants, and pesticide exposure is one of the key environmental stressors affecting their health in anthropogenically modified landscapes. Until recently, almost all information on routes and impacts of pesticide exposure came from honey bees, at least partially because they were the only model species required for environmental risk assessments (ERAs) for insect pollinators. Recently, there has been a surge in research activity focusing on pesticide exposure and effects for non- Apis bees, including other social bees (bumble bees and stingless bees) and solitary bees. These taxa vary substantially from honey bees and one another in several important ecological traits, including spatial and temporal activity patterns, foraging and nesting requirements, and degree of sociality. In this article, we review the current evidence base about pesticide exposure pathways and the consequences of exposure for non- Apis bees. We find that the insights into non- Apis bee pesticide exposure and resulting impacts across biological organizations, landscapes, mixtures, and multiple stressors are still in their infancy. The good news is that there are many promising approaches that could be used to advance our understanding, with priority given to informing exposure pathways, extrapolating effects, and determining how well our current insights (limited to very few species and mostly neonicotinoid insecticides under unrealistic conditions) can be generalized to the diversity of species and lifestyles in the global bee community. We conclude that future research to expand our knowledge would also be beneficial for ERAs and wider policy decisions concerning pollinator conservation and pesticide regulation.},

  abstract = {Abstract The development of the exposome concept has been one of the hallmarks of environmental and health research for the last decade. The exposome encompasses the life course environmental exposures including lifestyle factors from the prenatal period onwards. It has inspired many research programs and is expected to influence environmental and health research, practices, and policies. Yet, the links bridging toxicology and the exposome concept have not been well developed. In this review, we describe how the exposome framework can interface with and influence the field of toxicology, as well as how the field of toxicology can help advance the exposome field by providing the needed mechanistic understanding of the exposome impacts on health. Indeed, exposome-informed toxicology is expected to emphasize several orientations including (1) developing approaches integrating multiple stressors, in particular chemical mixtures, as well as the interaction of chemicals with other stressors, (2) using mechanistic frameworks such as the adverse outcome pathways to link the different stressors with toxicity outcomes, (3) characterizing the mechanistic basis of long-term effects by distinguishing different patterns of exposures and further exploring the environment-DNA interface through genetic and epigenetic studies, and (4) improving the links between environmental and human health, in particular through a stronger connection between alterations in our ecosystems and human toxicology. The exposome concept provides the linkage between the complex environment and contemporary mechanistic toxicology. What toxicology can bring to exposome characterization is a needed framework for mechanistic understanding and regulatory outcomes in risk assessment.},

  abstract = {Organisms are exposed to ever-changing complex mixtures of chemicals over the course of their lifetime. The need to more comprehensively describe this exposure and relate it to adverse health effects has led to formulation of the exposome concept in human toxicology. Whether this concept has utility in the context of environmental hazard and risk assessment has not been discussed in detail. In this Critical Perspective, we propose-by analogy to the human exposome-to define the eco-exposome as the totality of the internal exposure (anthropogenic and natural chemicals, their biotransformation products or adducts, and endogenous signaling molecules that may be sensitive to an anthropogenic chemical exposure) over the lifetime of an ecologically relevant organism. We describe how targeted and nontargeted chemical analyses and bioassays can be employed to characterize this exposure and discuss how the adverse outcome pathway concept could be used to link this exposure to adverse effects. Available methods, their limitations, and/or requirement for improvements for practical application of the eco-exposome concept are discussed. Even though analysis of the eco-exposome can be resource-intensive and challenging, new approaches and technologies make this assessment increasingly feasible. Furthermore, an improved understanding of mechanistic relationships between external chemical exposure(s), internal chemical exposure(s), and biological effects could result in the development of proxies, that is, relatively simple chemical and biological measurements that could be used to complement internal exposure assessment or infer the internal exposure when it is difficult to measure.

  abstract = {The current landscape of Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) provides a means of organizing information relating to the adverse effects elicited following exposure to chemicals. As such, AOPs are an excellent driver for the development and application of in silico models for predictive toxicology allowing for the direct relationship between chemistry and adverse effects to be established. Information may be extracted from AOPs to support the creation of (quantitative) structure-activity relationships [(Q)SARs] and to increase confidence in grouping and read-across. Any part of an AOP can be linked to these various types of in silico models. There is, however, an emphasis on using information from known molecular initiating events (MIEs) to create models including 2-D and 3-D structural alerts, SARs and QSARs. MIEs can be classified according to the nature of the interaction, for example, covalent reactivity, oxidative stress, phototoxicity, chronic receptor mediated, acute enzyme inhibition, unspecific, physical and other effects. Different types of MIEs require different approaches to their in silico modeling. Modeling Key Events and Key Event Relationships is useful if they represent the rate limiting step or key determinant of toxicity. Modeling of metabolism and chemical interactions will become part of AOP networks, which are also driving species-specific extrapolation and respective adaptation of models. With more information and data being captured, in silico approaches will increasingly support the application of knowledge from AOPs to build weight of evidence and support risk assessment, for example, in the context of Integrated Approaches to Testing and Assessment (IATAs).},

  abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems provide major benefits to human wellbeing-so-called ecosystem services (ES)-but are currently threatened among others by ecotoxicological pressure from chemicals reaching the environment. There is an increased motivation to incorporate ES in quantification tools that support decision-making, such as life cycle assessment (LCA). However, mechanistic models and frameworks that can systematically translate ecotoxicity effect data from chemical tests into eventual damage on species diversity, functional diversity, and ES in the field are still missing. While current approaches focus on translating predicted ecotoxicity impacts to damage in terms of species loss, no approaches are available in LCA and other comparative assessment frameworks for linking ecotoxicity to damage on ecosystem functioning or ES. To overcome this challenge, we propose a way forward based on evaluating available approaches to characterize damage of chemical pollution on freshwater ES. We first outline an overall framework for linking freshwater ecotoxicity effects to damage on related ES in compliance with the boundary conditions of quantitative, comparative assessments. Second, within the proposed framework, we present possible approaches for stepwise linking ecotoxicity effects to species loss, functional diversity loss, and damage on ES. Finally, we discuss strengths, limitations, and data availability of possible approaches for each step. Although most approaches for directly deriving damage on ES from either species loss or damage to functional diversity have not been operationalized, there are some promising ways forward. The Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) seems suitable to translate predicted ecotoxicity effects to a metric of quantitative damage on species diversity. A Trait Probability Density Framework (TPD) approach that incorporates various functional diversity components and functional groups could be adapted to link species loss to functional diversity loss. An Ecological Production Function (EPF) approach seems most promising for further linking functional diversity loss to damage on ES flows for human wellbeing. However, in order to integrate the entire pathway from predicted freshwater ecotoxicity to damage on ES into LCA and other comparative frameworks, the approaches adopted for each step need to be harmonized in terms of assumptions, boundary conditions and consistent interfaces with each other.},

This has resulted in the emergence of landscape ecotoxicology, a subdiscipline of ecotoxicology. However, landscape ecotoxicology has yet to become common practice in risk assessment due to the underdevelopment of techniques and a lack of standardized methods. In the present study, we demonstrate how geographic information systems (GISs) can serve as a standardized platform to integrate data, assess spatial patterns of ecotoxicological data for multiple species, and assess relationships between chemical mixture exposures and effects on biota for landscape ecotoxicological risks assessment. We use data collected under the Joint Oil Sands Monitoring Program in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region in Alberta, Canada. This dataset is composed of concentrations of contaminants including metals and polycyclic aromatic compounds, and health endpoints measured in 1100 biological samples, including tree swallows, amphibians, gull and tern eggs, plants, and mammals. We present 3 examples using a GIS as a platform and geospatial analysis to: 1) integrate data and assess spatial patterns of contaminant exposure in the region, 2) assess spatial patterns of exposures to complex mixtures, and 3) examine patterns of exposures and responses across the landscape. We summarize the methods used in the present study into a workflow for ease of use. The GIS methods allow researchers to identify hot spots of contamination, use georeferenced monitoring data to derive quantitative exposure-response relationships, and assess complex exposures with more realism.

  abstract = {Abstract Regulatory hazard and risk assessment of endocrine-active substances currently specifies four modes of action: interference with sex hormone (oestrogen, androgen) pathways, steroidogenesis, and thyroid hormone signalling. This does not encompass the full complexity of the endocrine system and its extended interfaces with environmental pollutants that can potentially disrupt the carefully maintained balance. Here we take the retinoid signalling pathway as a European case study for both, under- and unregulated endocrine pathways and outline the different levels of interference, discuss their adversity, and indicate crosstalk to other signalling pathways. Retinoid compounds already exist in drinking water sources, occur naturally in cyanobacterial blooms and/or enter surface waters via wastewater discharge, where they pose a potential hazard to the environment and human health - a situation that can be expected to worsen due to water shortages induced by climate-change and population growth. We briefly review relevant aspects of current endocrine disruptor (ED) testing for regulatory purposes and then expand upon the needs for inclusion of disruption of retinoid signalling in (ED) regulatory safety assessment contributing to adverse health outcomes that include cognitive function and neurological disease. An overview of developmental effects of retinoid signalling disruption across species highlights critical processes and potential crosstalk with other signalling pathways. A focused weight of evidence-based evaluation of the biologically plausible associations between neurological disorders and altered retinoid signalling highlights the evidence gaps. We show that monitoring only a limited number of anthropogenic priority chemicals in water is insufficient to address the environmental risks of retinoid signalling disruption. To comprehensively assess impacts on the endpoints, processes, and pathways of the endocrine system that are most vulnerable to chemical interference we need further investigation of the true mixture composition in environmental matrices. On a weight of evidence-basis this information can then be integrated into a reliable, inclusive, quantitative approach that ultimately accommodates all the critical pathways. By focusing on the retinoid signalling pathway, we intend to improve the scope and relevance of an integrated approach for the risk assessment of endocrine disruptors.},

  abstract = {Environmental health risk assessments often involve assessing the potential health effects of exposure to multiple chemicals at once (i.e., complex mixtures). Because the possible number of chemical combinations is very large, few controlled in vivo toxicological studies with chemical mixtures are relevant or practical. In lieu of specific mixture toxicity data, the segregated hazard index (HI) approach has been used to determine whether simultaneous exposures may warrant further investigation due to their combined adverse effects. Each chemical is assigned to one or more target organs based on critical effects; HIs for each target organ are generated by summing the individual hazard quotients for each of the chemicals assigned to that organ or organ system. To conduct this phased risk assessment approach in a consistent manner, a comprehensive, systematized list of toxicity targets for implementing this approach is needed. We present a comprehensive and standardized list of toxicity target organs and systems (TTOS), with example data sets, for consistent implementation of the segregated HI method. This method is designed to facilitate the standardization of the widespread use of the basic segregated HI approach. The basic hazard index mixtures screening (BHIMS) tool allows for rapid identification of exposure concerns that may warrant further and more sophisticated assessment.

Using combinations of human relevant in vitro models, chemical analysis and computational (in silico) approaches bring advantages compared to animal studies. These include a greater focus on the human species and on molecular mechanisms and kinetics, identification of Adverse Outcome Pathways and downstream Key Events as well as the possibility of addressing susceptible populations and additional endpoints. Much of the advancement and progress made in the Next Generation Risk Assessment (NGRA) have been primarily focused on new approach methodologies (NAMs) and physiologically based kinetic (PBK) modelling without incorporating human biomonitoring (HBM). The integration of toxicokinetics (TK) and PBK modelling is an essential component of NGRA. PBK models are essential for describing in quantitative terms the TK processes with a focus on the effective dose at the expected target site. Furthermore, the need for PBK models is amplified by the increasing scientific and regulatory interest in aggregate and cumulative exposure as well as interactions of chemicals in mixtures. Since incorporating HBM data strengthens approaches and reduces uncertainties in risk assessment, here we elaborate on the integrated use of TK, PBK modelling and HBM in chemical risk assessment highlighting opportunities as well as challenges and limitations. Examples are provided where HBM and TK/PBK modelling can be used in both exposure assessment and hazard characterization shifting from external exposure and animal dose/response assays to animal-free, internal exposure-based NGRA.},

Residents' perspectives on chemical exposure and risk were also investigated. HBM4EU's research was designed to answer specific short-term and long-term policy questions at national and European levels, and for its results to directly support regulatory action on chemicals. A strategy was established to prioritise chemicals for analysis in human matrices, with a total of 18 substances/substance groups chosen to be investigated throughout the five-and a -half-year project. HBM4EU produced new evidence of human exposure levels, developed reference values for exposure, investigated determinants of exposure and derived health-based guidance values for those substances. In addition, HBM4EU promoted the use of human biomonitoring data in chemical risk assessment and developed innovative tools and methods linking chemicals to possible health impacts, such as effect biomarkers. Furthermore, HBM4EU advanced understand of effects from combined exposures and methods to identify emerging chemicals. With the aim of supporting policy implementation, science-to-policy workshops were organised, providing opportunities for joint reflection and dialogue on research results. I, and indicators were developed to assess temporal and spatial patterns in the exposure of European population. A sustainable human biomonitoring monitoring framework, producing comparable quality assured data would allow: the evaluation of time trends; the exploration of spatial trends: the evaluation of the influence of socio-economic conditions on chemical exposure. Therefore, such a framework should be included in the European Chemicals' Strategy for Sustainability and the data would support the Zero Pollution Action Plan.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of metabolic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and chronic liver diseases among others, has been rising for several years. Epidemiology and mechanistic (in vivo, in vitro and in silico) toxicology have recently provided compelling evidence implicating the chemical environment in the pathogenesis of these diseases. In this review, we will describe the biological processes that contribute to the development of metabolic diseases targeted by metabolic disruptors, and will propose an integrated pathophysiological vision of their effects on several organs. With regard to these pathomechanisms, we will discuss the needs, and the stakes of evolving the testing and assessment of endocrine disruptors to improve the prevention and management of metabolic diseases that have become a global epidemic since the end of last century.},

  abstract = {Bees carry out vital ecosystem services by pollinating both wild and economically important crop plants. However, while performing this function, bee pollinators may encounter potentially harmful xenobiotics in the environment such as pesticides (fungicides, herbicides and insecticides). Understanding the key factors that influence the toxicological outcomes of bee exposure to these chemicals, in isolation or combination, is essential to safeguard their health and the ecosystem services they provide. In this regard, recent work using toxicogenomic and phylogenetic approaches has begun to identify, at the molecular level, key determinants of pesticide sensitivity in bee pollinators. These include detoxification systems that convert pesticides to less toxic forms and key residues in insecticide target-sites that underlie species-specific insecticide selectivity. Here we review this emerging body of research and summarise the state of knowledge of the molecular determinants of pesticide sensitivity in bee pollinators. We identify gaps in our knowledge for future research and examine how an understanding of the genetic basis of bee sensitivity to pesticides can be leveraged to, a) predict and avoid negative bee-pesticide interactions and facilitate the future development of pest-selective bee-safe insecticides, and b) inform traditional effect assessment approaches in bee pesticide risk assessment and address issues of ecotoxicological concern.},

  abstract = {Assessment of a chemical's potential to cause permanent changes in the genetic code has been a common practice in the industry and regulatory settings for decades. Furthermore, the genetic toxicity battery of tests has typically been employed during the earliest stages of the research and development programs of new product development. A positive outcome from such battery has a major impact on the chemical's utility, industrial hygiene, product stewardship practices, and product life cycle analysis, among many other decisions that need to be taken by the industry, even before the registration of a chemical is undertaken. Under the prevailing regulatory paradigm, the dichotomous (yes/no) evaluation of the chemical's genotoxic potential leads to a conservative, linear no-threshold (LNT) risk assessment, unless compelling and undeniable data to the contrary can be provided to satisfy regulators, typically in a number of different global jurisdictions. With the current advent of predictive methods, new testing paradigms, mode-of-action/adverse outcome pathways, and quantitative risk assessment approaches, various stakeholders are starting to employ these state-of-the-science methodologies to further the conversation on decision making and advance the regulatory paradigm beyond the dominant LNT status quo. This commentary describes these novel methodologies, relevant biological responses, and how these can affect internal and regulatory risk assessment approaches. Environ. Mol.

Different types of H\&amp;PCPs often contain the same chemicals and have potential for aggregate exposure. Therefore, product use patterns should be investigated to assess exposure and health risk. Results A nationwide survey was conducted in Korea to examine the use of 16 types of H\&amp;PCPs, to obtain data that can be used for such assessments. The initial analysis focused on identifying usage patterns, such as the frequency of use and amount of product used per application. Then, co-use in 16 product categories were analyzed. Family size, marital status and age were, respectively, recognized as the critical demographic factor for classification of the frequency of use in laundry products, cleaning products and shower products. In laundry products, cleaning products and shower products, frequent H\&amp;PCPs co-use patterns according to demographical factor were recognized. Chances of exposure of chemical ingredients to participants were investigated based on the usage of individual products. 32 chemicals among all investigated ingredients were identified to be potentially exposed to more than half of the participants, and 21 chemicals are classified above Class 4 in acute toxicity. Conclusions Personal preference was not observed both in the use frequency and the amount per application of H\&amp;PCPs, among all participants. Instead, household duties were found to be associated with the yearly use frequency of household care products. In addition, the yearly chemical profiles of individual consumer were obtained, and the chemicals that have multiple chances of exposure and concomitant health risk in daily life were identified. The results provide the overview of distribution of chemicals in daily life, and essential ground for aggregate exposure assessment in Korea.},

  abstract = {Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) are useful tools for assessing the potential risks associated with exposure to various stressors, including chemicals and environmental contaminants. They provide a framework for understanding the causal relationships between different biological events that can lead to adverse outcomes (AO). However, developing an AOP is a challenging task, particularly in identifying the molecular initiating events (MIEs) and key events (KEs) that constitute it. Here, we propose a systems biology strategy that can assist in the development of AOPs by screening publicly available databases, literature with the text mining tool AOP-helpFinder, and pathway/network analyses. This approach is straightforward to use, requiring only the name of the stressor and adverse outcome to be studied. From this, it quickly identifies potential KEs and literature providing mechanistic information on the links between the KEs. The proposed approach was applied to the recently developed AOP 441 on radiation-induced microcephaly, resulting in the confirmation of the KEs that were already present and identification of new relevant KEs, thereby validating the strategy. In conclusion, our systems biology approach represents a valuable tool to simplify the development and enrichment of Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs), thus supporting alternative methods in toxicology.},

  abstract = {A combination experimental and computational approach was developed to predict chemical transport into saliva. A serous-acinar chemical transport assay was established to measure chemical transport with nonphysiological (standard cell culture medium) and physiological (using surrogate plasma and saliva medium) conditions using 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy) a metabolite of the pesticide chlorpyrifos. High levels of TCPy protein binding were observed in cell culture medium and rat plasma resulting in different TCPy transport behaviors in the 2 experimental conditions. In the nonphysiological transport experiment, TCPy reached equilibrium at equivalent concentrations in apical and basolateral chambers. At higher TCPy doses, increased unbound TCPy was observed, and TCPy concentrations in apical and basolateral chambers reached equilibrium faster than lower doses, suggesting only unbound TCPy is able to cross the cellular monolayer. In the physiological experiment, TCPy transport was slower than nonphysiological conditions, and equilibrium was achieved at different concentrations in apical and basolateral chambers at a comparable ratio (0.034) to what was previously measured in rats dosed with TCPy (saliva:blood ratio: 0.049). A cellular transport computational model was developed based on TCPy protein binding kinetics and simulated all transport experiments reasonably well using different permeability coefficients for the 2 experimental conditions (1.14 vs 0.4 cm/h for nonphysiological and physiological experiments, respectively). The computational model was integrated into a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model and accurately predicted TCPy concentrations in saliva of rats dosed with TCPy. Overall, this study demonstrates an approach to predict chemical transport in saliva, potentially increasing the utility of salivary biomonitoring in the future.},

However, additional efforts are needed to expand their development and their use in regulatory decision making. A virtual symposium was held during the 2021 Cooperation Centre for Scientific Research Relative to Tobacco (CORESTA) Smoke Science and Product Technology (SSPT) conference (titled "Advancing New Alternative Methods for Tobacco Harm Reduction"), with the goals of introducing the concepts and potential application of NAMs in the evaluation of potentially reduced-risk (PRR) tobacco products. At the symposium, experts from regulatory agencies, research organizations, and NGOs shared insights on the status of available tools, strengths, limitations, and opportunities in the application of NAMs using case examples from safety assessments of chemicals and tobacco products. Following seven presentations providing background and application of NAMs, a discussion was held where the presenters and audience discussed the outlook for extending the NAMs toxicological applications for tobacco products. The symposium, endorsed by the CORESTA In Vitro Tox Subgroup, Biomarker Subgroup, and NextG Tox Task Force, illustrated common ground and interest in science-based engagement across the scientific community and stakeholders in support of tobacco regulatory science.

The AEP-AOP framework organizes data on the causal events that ocur over the entire source-exposure-response continuum of a chemical's release. The proposed taxonomy uses this framework in two ways. First, four top-level categories are established based on the location in the continuum where a chemical interaction occurs. Second, each top-level category has two or more subcategories that are based on concepts taken from AEPs and AOPs. The categories and subcategories are potentially useful in developing standardized definitions for interaction terms and improving our understanding of the impacts of chemical interactions on risk to human health and the environment.},

  abstract = {As the number of chemicals and environmental toxicants in commerce continue to increase, so does the need to understand the links between exposure to these stressors and any potential toxic reactions. Assessing the impact of these stressors on public health as well as our environment requires an understanding of the underlying mechanistic processes connecting their introduction into the environment to the associated adverse outcomes. Traditional in vivo methods of toxicity testing have become too costly and inefficient. In recent times, in vitro high-throughput toxicity screening methods have been introduced to reduce the burden of in vivo testing and keep pace with the ever increasing number of required tests. The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) concept has been adopted by many in the toxicology community as a framework for linking the biological events that occur from the point of contact with these stressors and the resulting adverse outcome. This provides a mechanistic framework for understanding the potential impacts of perturbations that are measured via in vitro testing strategies. The aggregate exposure pathway (AEP) has been proposed as a companion framework to the AOP. The goal of the AEP is to describe the path the introduction of the stressor into the environment at its source to a target site within an individual that is comparable with the concentrations in the in vitro toxicity tests. Together, these frameworks provide a comprehensive view of the source to adverse outcome continuum. Standardizing our representation of the mechanistic information in this way allows for increased interoperability for computational models describing different parts of the system. It also aids in translating new research in exposure science and toxicology for risk assessors and decision makers when assessing the impact of specific stressors on endpoints of regulatory significance.},

  abstract = {The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://ctdbase.org) is a freely available resource that promotes understanding about the mechanisms by which environmental exposures influence human health. Four categories of content are manually curated from the literature: toxicogenomics (chemical-gene interactions), diseases (chemical-disease and gene-disease associations), phenotypes (chemical-induced phenotypes), and exposure data (environmental stressor-receptor-event-outcome relationships). Exposure details, including stressor source, receptor age, sex, smoking status, biomarker levels, correlations with disease or phenotypes, and geographic location are also recorded. In our curation paradigm, controlled vocabularies, ontologies, mnemonic codes and structured notation are used to transform the literature into a semantic, computable structure, enabling integration among the four categories as well as with gene attributes, molecular pathways, species, and general toxicology information to provide a knowledgebase of over 36 million toxicogenomic relationships. These data can be explored with queries and analytical tools to inform hypothesis development connecting chemicals/drugs, genes/proteins, diseases/phenotypes, taxa, functional annotations, pathways, and population-based exposure events. In addition, they provide unique opportunities to generate predictive adverse outcome pathways (connecting chemical-protein molecular initiating events, key phenotype events, adverse diseases, and population-level health outcomes) as well as aggregate exposure pathways (relating real-world measurements of environmental stressors and biomarkers to demographics). CTD's centralization of exposure science data, integration with chemical-gene, disease and phenotype modules, and additional analysis tools provide a unique resource to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action by which environmental exposures affect human health.},

  abstract = {Abstract The exposome is a term used to characterize exposure to all exogenous environmental agents, socioeconomic conditions, lifestyle, and diet along with markers of endogenous processes across the lifetime of an organism or community of interest. It integrates exposures with molecular or apical responses over time. Measures of the exposome enable data-driven discovery or hypothesis-free research, identifying associations between exposures and biologic endpoints of importance. Two strategies for linking the exposome to health outcomes have been described, and both can be useful. A ``top-down'' approach adopts untargeted analytic including omic methods to measure features of exogenous and endogenous exposures in biologic specimens. This approach allows contrasts of profiles between diseased and healthy populations. Omic profiles can be used to generate hypotheses to identify particularly relevant exposures, develop biomarkers for high-throughput screens, and determine sources of exposure. A ``bottom-up'' approach starts with a set of exposures from multiple sources to determine pathways or networks by which those exposures lead to disease. This is laborious and if confined to external sources of exposure, it misses chemical features of the internal environment associated with, for example, metabolism, gender, inflammation, obesity, stress, and discrimination. Most kinds of cancer are multifactorial in origin, and a causal pie model is often used to depict this complexity. Various combinations of component causes accumulate over a lifetime before becoming sufficient to initiate tumor formation and growth. Key events, alone and in combination, initiate adverse outcome pathways. Early biologic changes at low dose levels, exposures during critical windows of vulnerability during various life stages, interactions between exposures and components of mixtures, and gene-environment and internal-external interactions must be considered. In addition to technological challenges, this presentation will briefly raise four issues that must be considered when applying the concept of the exposome to the origins and prevention of cancer: 1) Biologic assumptions: Which signatures, biomarkers, key events, or adverse outcome pathways are important in the pathogenesis of cancer and what determines their variability among individuals or communities? 2) What biologic changes associated with measures of the exposome are adaptive or adverse? When do adaptive responses become adverse? 3) Multilevel variables---individual, family, community, and societal---influence disease risk. Which chemical and nonchemical stressors should be included in exposome assessment? 4) For purposes of prevention, what are the various sources of relevant exposures and their relative ranking in aggregated exposure pathways associated with adverse outcome pathways related to cancer?

  abstract = {Human Risk Assessment (RA) of combined exposure to multiple chemicals follows the steps of RA namely problem formulation, exposure assessment, hazard assessment and risk characterisation. Over the last decade, scientific advisory bodies have published a range of harmonised guidance documents to provide practical approaches for risk assessors. These include the WHO, the US-EPA, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission, the OECD and the recent EFSA MIXTOX guidance document dealing with harmonised methodologies for the human health, animal health and ecological RA areas. On May 21st 2021, the Scientific Committee of EFSA published a draft guidance document on scientific criteria to group chemicals in assessment groups using hazard-driven criteria and prioritisation methods using exposure-driven and risk-based approaches. The latter guidance and future challenges were the topic of this international workshop which was held online in the afternoons of the 18th, 19th and 20st October 2021. First, a plenary session provided overviews of European and international activities in the field including WHO, OECD, US-EPA, JRC and EFSA. With a total of 118 participants including national and international scientific advisory bodies, academics and researchers, NGOs, industry, risk assessors, risk managers, four discussions groups were created for three break-out group sessions: 1) Hazard-driven criteria for grouping multiple chemicals into assessment groups; 2) Exposure-driven and risk-based criteria for the prioritisation of multiple chemicals 3) Data gaps and future challenges for human health and environmental RA of combined exposure to multiple chemicals to identify priority topics of international relevance and a way forward to address these topics. A final discussion and wrap-up session concluded the meeting. This event report provides a summary of the discussions together with conclusions and recommendations.},

  abstract = {People are constantly exposed to particulate matter and chemicals released during fires. However, there are still few studies on gas and particulate emissions related to exposure to burning firewood and charcoal during forest fires, making it difficult to understand the effects on the health of the population. The objective of this study was to quantify the metal(loid)s present in the smoke from wood and charcoal fires through the deposition of metals in beef topside and pork loin, considering the routes of skin exposure, inhalation, and ingestion, contributing to the understanding of metals in the increase of the risks of cancer and mortality associated with firefighting and children. The concentrations of metals [aluminum (Al), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), vanadium (V), zinc (Zn)] and metalloids arsenic (As) were determined by inductively coupled plasma--mass spectrometry (ICP OES) after microwave digestion. Moreover, we assessed the associated risk regarding the elemental intake of these elements through the smoke, using the hazard quotient (HQ), hazard index (HI), Total Hazard Index (HIt), and carcinogenic risk (CR). All samples had results for HQ and HIt \&lt; 1, indicating a non-potential health risk. However, the carcinogenic risks posed by As and Cr via the three exposure pathways (except for inhalation exposure to children and adults, and by Cr via ingestion and inhalation for children and adults) exceeded the standard threshold. In conclusion, continuous exposure of firefighters or children to smoke from fires containing high concentrations of heavy metals such as As and Cr can be harmful to health. The study used animal tissues; thus, new methods must be developed to quantify the concentration of heavy metals deposited in human tissue when humans are exposed to smoke from fires.},

  abstract = {The K{\aa}fjord area in northern Norway hosts numerous Cu deposits that were subjected to mining activities back in the nineteenth century. Relicts of the historical mining activity are still visible at several abandoned mines and associated mine waste disposal sites that may represent an environmental threat. The area was subjected to mining activities during the nineteenth century and abandoned mines and associated mine waste disposal sites still may represent a significant environmental threat. The Cu mineralization, found within the Paleoproterozoic Alta-Kv{\ae}nangen Tectonic Window, primarily occurs as epigenetic sulfide-quartz-carbonate hydrothermal veins that crosscut the Kvenvik volcano-sedimentary complex and the overlying Storviknes sedimentary sequence. This study aims to determine the geochemical composition of stream sediments associated with the sediment-hosted Cu deposits and examine the role of host lithologies in the dispersion of elements associated with the deposits. Sediments from two streams and a river in the K{\aa}fjord area were analyzed using phase and element analyses (aqua regia chemistry), complemented by a seven-step sequential extraction procedure. Results from Annaselva stream, draining Cu occurrences in the carbonate sediments of the Storviknes sequence, showed a significant positive correlation of Cu with mobile chalcophile elements (Pb, Zn, Ni, Tl, Hg, Ag, Sb, Bi) and lithophile elements (Sr, Ca, Ba, Al, K). In contrast, Brakkelva stream, draining the mafic volcanics of the Kvenvik complex, exhibited no statistically significant correlations between Cu and any of the analyzed elements. M{\o}llneselva River, draining both lithologies, showed a strong Cu-Sc correlation, with principal component analysis indicating limited distinction between lithology-derived elements. These results did not completely align with statistical analysis outcomes highlighting the challenges of statistical data interpretation using a limited number of samples.},

In natural waters, these interactions can limit copper bioavailability and result in copper transport from the water column to the sediment. In the present study, data on the fate of copper added to lakes, microcosms, and mesocosms were compiled and analyzed to determine copper removal rates from the water column. Studies on copper behavior in sediment were also reviewed to assess the potential for remobilization. A previously developed, screening-level fate and transport model (tableau input coupled kinetic equilibrium transport--unit world model [TICKET--UWM]) was parameterized and applied to quantify copper removal rates and remobilization in a standardized lake setting. Field and modeling results were reconciled within a framework that links copper removal rates to lake depths and solids fluxes. The results of these analyses provide converging evidence that, on a large scale, copper is removed relatively quickly from natural waters. For the majority of studies examined, more than 70\% of the added copper was removed from the water column within 16 d of dosing.

Water samples from nine stations, sediment samples from 23 stations, plankton samples from five stations, and six species of macroalgae were collected and subjected to heavy metal analysis using atomic absorption spec-trophotometry (AAS). Only Cu and Zn were detected in the water samples. The plankton samples had only Zn, Cu, and Cr. The average metal concentrations in macroalgae fell in the decreasing order of Cu {$>$} Zn {$>$} Cr {$>$} Cd {$>$} Pb. In sediment samples, the metal order was as follows: Zn {$>$} Cu {$>$} Cr {$>$} Pb {$>$} Cd. Multivariate statistical an-alyses including principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were used to identify the source of the metal contamination. The metals were found to originate from a blend of both anthropogenic and geogenic sources. Pollution monitoring indices including geoaccumulation index (Igeo), contamination factor, contamination degree (Cdeg), pollution load index (PLI), and potential ecological risk (PER) were calculated using the metal data. In the study area, Igeo values of the metals showed pollution grades from 0 (uncontaminated) to 6 (extremely contaminated). Cdeg fell in classes from 1 (low contamination) to 4 (very high contamination). PLI values ranged between 0 and 5.68. PER values expressed that except for a few stations located at higher elevations in the glacial outwash plains, all other sites were highly polluted. The high level of pollution indices in the sites can be attributed to the anthropogenic activities persistent in the study area.},

Investigation into the vegetation of geothermal areas is crucial and may contribute to their proper protection in the future and bring more understanding under what conditions the plants respond to an ecologically more extreme situation. Plants from geothermally active sites were enriched with metals as compared to the same species from non-geothermal control sites (at an average from about 150 m from geothermal activity). The enriched metals consisted of Cd, Co, Cu, Fe and Ni in C. vulgaris; Cd, Mn and Ti in E. nigrum; Hg and Pb in F. vivipara; and Cd, Fe and Hg in T. praecox. Notably, C. vulgaris, E. nigrum, F. vivipara and T. praecox had remarkably high concentrations of Ti at levels typical of toxicity thresholds. Cd and Pb (except for C. vulgaris and F. vivipara) were not accumulated in the shoots of geothermal plants. C. vulgaris from geothermal and control sites was characterised by the highest bioaccumulation factor (BF) of Ti and Mn; E. nigrum and F. vivipara by the highest BF of Ti and Cr; and T. praecox by the highest BF of Ti and Zn compared to the other elements. In comparison with the other examined species, F. vivipara from geothermal sites had the highest concentration of Ti in above-ground parts at any concentration of plant-available Ti in soil.},

  abstract = {Submarine tailing disposal (STD) in fjords from land-based mines is common practice in Norway and takes place in other regions worldwide. We synthesize the results of a multidisciplinary programme on environmental impacts of STDs in Norwegian fjords, providing new knowledge that can be applied to assess and mitigate impact of tailing disposal globally, both for submarine and deep-sea activities. Detailed geological seafloor mapping provided data on natural sedimentation to monitor depositional processes on the seafloor. Modelling and analytical techniques were used to assess the behaviour of tailing particles and process-chemicals in the environment, providing novel tools for monitoring. Toxicity tests showed biological impacts on test species due to particulate and chemical exposure. Hypersedimentation mesocosm and field experiments showed a varying response on the benthos, allowing to determine the transition zone in the STD impact area. Recolonisation studies indicate that full community recovery and normalisation of metal leakage rates may take several decades due to bioturbation and slow burial of sulfidic tailings. The results are synthesised to provide guidelines for the development of best available techniques for STDs.},

One of the most important environmental issues and economic burdens of industrial mining on land is the safe storage of the vast amounts of waste produced. Traditionally, tailings have been stored in land dams, but the lack of land availability, potential risk of dam failure and topography in coastal areas in certain countries results in increasing disposal of tailings into marine systems. This review describes the different submarine tailing disposal methods used in the world in general and in Norway in particular, their impact on the environment (e.g. hyper-sedimentation, toxicity, processes related to changes in grain shape and size, turbidity), current legislation and need for future research. Understanding these impacts on the habitat and biota is essential to assess potential ecosystem changes and to develop best available techniques and robust management plans.},

Non-toxic organic arsenic in raw Greenland halibut (N~=~10) and salmon (N~=~4) did not transform to carcinogenic inorganic arsenic during industrial cold smoking. Hence inorganic arsenic was low ({$<$}0.003~mg/kg wet weight) in both raw and smoked fillets rich in organic arsenic (up to 9.0 mg/kg for farmed salmon and 0.7~mg/kg for wild caught Greenland halibut per wet weight). Processing salmon did not significantly change any levels (calculated both per wet weight, dry weight or lipid content). Cold smoking decreased total arsenic (17\%) and increased PCB congeners (10-22\%) in Greenland halibut (wet weight). However PFOS, PCB and PBDE congeners were not different in processed Greenland halibut when corrected for water loss or lipid content.},

The main objectives of this research were to define baseline concentrations of trace metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn) in M. balthica and to evaluate antioxidant responses as biomarkers of anthropogenic stress in these organisms. The antioxidant parameters examined included the levels of glutathione and the activities of several glutathione-dependent and antioxidant enzymes: glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II (EC 4.4.1.5 and EC 3.1.2.6), glutathione S-transferases (EC 2.5.1.18), glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2), glutathione peroxidases (EC1.11.1.9 and EC 2.5.1.18, respectively, for Se-dependent and Se-independent forms), superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), and catalase (EC 1.11.1.6). Organisms revealed enhanced concentrations of lead in both Keret stations, Khaypudyr, and Mezen, and high levels of copper in Keret and cadmium in Khaypudyr. At the biochemical level, organisms from Pechora 3, Pechora 5, and Dvina were not statistically different, whereas those from Mezen and Khaypudyr exhibited higher activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glyoxalase II. Catalase levels were lower in Mezen and Khaypudyr. More heterogeneous were the responses of glyoxalase I and glutathione S-transferases, while no significant differences among the stations were observed for glutathione reductase. Multiple regression analyses revealed significant positive relationships between the main antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidases, superoxide dismutase, glyoxalase I, and glyoxalase II), and confirmed the exception of catalase, which, when significant, was negatively correlated with the other parameters. The results support the suitability of antioxidant responses as biomarkers of pollutant exposure and/or toxicity for arctic biomonitoring programs even though only moderately polluted sites were sampled.},

Between 14 and 25 sites were sampled in each of the eight catchments ranging in size from 12 to 35 km2. Results show that close to the smelters in Monchegorsk and Nikel, topsoil is clearly enriched in Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Te and V. Cu and Ni median contents in topsoils collected close to Monchegorsk are about 600 times higher than in the Finnish catchments. The effect of open-cast mining and waste dumps of alkaline rocks from the nephelinite industry near Kirovsk can be seen in the elevated contents of Al, Ba, K, La, Mn, Na, Sr, Ti, Y and Zn in topsoil collected in a nearby catchment. For many elements, however, variations observed in single catchments are as great as the total regional variation. Several elements (e.g. Cd, Hg, Cu, Ni, Pb, S, Zn) show strong positive correlation between the organic content of the sample and the element content observed. Thus it is necessary to determine the organic content of the samples and correct the element levels when using depth-related soil samples (here, the 0-5 cm topsoil layer) for regional mapping.},

The metal concentrations were higher in mainland China than in the Arctic region, and this is likely associated with the comparatively lower rates of industrial production and human activity in the Arctic region. Principal component analysis and correlation results revealed two radionuclides sources types in mosses, i.e., soil (K-40, U-238, Ra-226, Ra-228 and Ra-228) and atmospheric (Pb-210 (Pb-210(ex)), Be-7 Cs-137). Clustering and correlation analyses showed that different sources such as traffic (suspended dust), fossil fuels, dry and wet deposition (atmosphere and rainfall), and soil contributed to metal accumulation in mosses.The correlation between radionuclides and metals supported thew observations, confirmed the accuracy of our results, and suggests that radionuclides are useful for identifying the source of metals in moss samples. The concentration ratios (CR) values of the radionuclides and the bioaccumulation factor (BCF) and enrichment factor (EF) values of metals in mosses helped identify the most environmentally sensitive moss, i.e., BS (Brom paradoxum), which can be used for screening and monitoring radionuclides and metal pollution in urban atmospheres. These results support the use of analysing radionuclides in mosses to identify metal sources, and the potential use of mosses can to determine the atmospheric deposition fluxes of radionuclides.

The dominant elements in the first component were Fe, Al, V, Ni, Cr, Cu and Pb. This component is interpreted as a soil dust factor. The concentrations in R. lanuginosum and C. nivalis of these elements are believed to be highly influenced by soil dust. Pb concentrations in moss and lichen may also be influenced by other sources as Pb also had some correlation's with the third component. Zn and Cd and to a lesser extent.

The third component was highly dominated by Hg with a lesser influence of Pb and As, Zn, Cd and Hg concentrations in R. lanuginosum and C. nivalis are believed to be influenced by other sources than soil dust which may be long-range atmospheric transport. In general, both the within locality and the between locality variability in the values of the three components decreased in the order soil, humus, R. lanuginosum and C. nivalis.

This is an inevitable precondition for using these organisms as biomonitors. Our results indicate a net accumulation strategy for Cu and Pb (within the given experimental constraints), but a tendency for regulation of Zn and especially for Cd. Two-compartment models were successfully fitted to the data, leading to rate constants statistically different from zero, which were validated by independent experiments. An extrapolation to field conditions is not possible without further evaluation. The collectives investigated may be regarded as potentially suitable biomonitors of Cu and Pb, but probably not of Zn and Cd. More information is required for a wider range of external metal exposures and the potential influences of life-history status on metal toxicokinetics must be clarified, before this approach can be fully adopted in the assessment of environmental quality.},

Although several studies have demonstrated correlations between different pollutants and various traffic variables, they mainly focused on roads with medium to high traffic density ({$>$}30,000 vehicles per day). In this study we have focused on investigating tire wear particles and road-related metals (zinc, copper, lead, chromium, nickel, and the metalloid arsenic) in the soils of low traffic roads in rural areas (650-14,250 vehicles per day). Different explanatory factors were investigated, such as traffic density, speed, \% heavy vehicles, organic matter content, annual precipitation, soil types and roadside slope profiles. The results show high levels of tire wear particles, from 2000 to 26,400 mg/kg (0.2-2.6 \% tire wear in d.w. soil), which is up to five times higher compared to previously reported values in roadside soils of high traffic density areas. A weak but significant correlation was found between tire wear particles, traffic speed and the annual precipitation. No significant relationship was found between tire wear particles metals. The concentrations of metals were comparable to previous studies of high traffic areas of Norway, as well as both urban and rural soils in other countries. For the metals, all factors together explained 45 \% of the variation observed, with traffic density (11 \%) and organic matter content (10 \%) as the most important single variables. The analysis of tire wear particles in soils using Pyrolysis Gas chromatography Mass Spectrometry is challenging, and the results presented demonstrate the need for pretreatment to remove organic matter from the samples before analysis.},

Carbon and lipid sources were assessed using {$\delta$}(13) C in muscle tissue and fatty acid (FA) profiles in subcutaneous adipose tissue as chemical tracers. A negative relationship between total Hg and {$\delta$}(13) C suggested that polar bears feeding in areas with higher riverine inputs of terrestrial carbon accumulate more Hg than bears feeding in areas with lower freshwater input. Mercury concentrations were also positively related to the FA 20:1n-9, which is biosynthesized in large amounts in Calanus copepods. This result raises the hypothesis that Calanus glacialis are an important link in the uptake of Hg in the marine food web and ultimately in polar bears. Unadjusted total Hg, Se, and As concentrations showed greater geographical variation among polar bear subpopulations compared with concentrations adjusted for carbon and lipid sources. The Hg concentrations adjusted for carbon and lipid sources in Bering-Chukchi Sea polar bear liver tissue remained the lowest among subpopulations. Based on these findings, the authors suggest that carbon and lipid sources for polar bears should be taken into account when one is assessing spatial and temporal trends of long-range transported trace elements.},

  abstract = {Spatial trends and comparative changes in time of selected trace elements were studied in liver tissue from polar bears from ten different subpopulation locations in Alaska, Canadian Arctic and East Greenland. For nine of the trace elements (As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Mn, Pb, Rb, Se and Zn) spatial trends were investigated in 136 specimens sampled during 2005-2008 from bears from these ten subpopulations. Concentrations of Hg, Se and As were highest in the (northern and southern) Beaufort Sea area and lowest in (western and southern) Hudson Bay area and Chukchi/Bering Sea. In contrast, concentrations of Cd showed an increasing trend from east to west. Minor or no spatial trends were observed for Cu, Mn, Rb and Zn. Spatial trends were in agreement with previous studies, possibly explained by natural phenomena. To assess temporal changes of Cd, Hg, Se and Zn concentrations during the last decades, we compared our results to previously published data. These time comparisons suggested recent Hg increase in East Greenland polar bears. This may be related to Hg emissions and/or climate-induced changes in Hg cycles or changes in the polar bear food web related to global warming. Also, Hg:Se molar ratio has increased in East Greenland polar bears, which suggests there may be an increased risk for Hg(2+)-mediated toxicity. Since the underlying reasons for spatial trends or changes in time of trace elements in the Arctic are still largely unknown, future studies should focus on the role of changing climate and trace metal emissions on geographical and temporal trends of trace elements.},

The spatial and temporal variability of heavy metal distribution was studied in two Spitsbergen fjords - Kongsfjorden and Hornsund. Sediment cores from five stations in Kongsfjorden and six in Hornsund were collected in 2018-2019 and used for measurement of heavy metal concentrations (Hg, Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn). Sediment layers were dated by the 210Pb method to reveal the history of contamination. Isotopic lead compo-sition was used to study sources of Pb. Loads of heavy metals to fjord deposits were calculated based on mass sediment accumulation rates. The heavy metal loads varied spatially and reached ranged 0.3 mg m- 2 yr-1 for Hg, 57.6 mg m- 2 yr-1 for Pb, 0.5 mg m- 2 yr-1 for Cd, 101 mg m- 2 yr-1 for Cu, and 117 mg m- 2 yr-1 for Zn. Heavy metal discharge from the glaciers to the glacial bays were much higher compared to discharge in central and outer fjord parts. This may suggest that glaciers can be important secondary sources of pollutants to fjords.},

Recent reports underline the importance of secondary sources of pollution, e.g. melting glaciers, thawing permafrost or increased riverine run-off. This article reviews reports on the European Arctic-we concentrate on the Svalbard region-and environmental contamination by inorganic pollutants (heavy metals and artificial radionuclides), including their transport pathways, their fate in the Arctic environment and the concentrations of individual elements in the ecosystem. This review presents in detail the secondary contaminant sources and tries to identify knowledge gaps, as well as indicate needs for further research. Concentrations of heavy metals and radionuclides in Svalbard have been studied, in various environmental elements since the beginning of the twentieth century. In the last 5 years, the highest concentrations of Cd (13 mg kg(-1)) and As (28 mg kg(-1)) were recorded for organic-rich soils, while levels of Pb (99 mg kg(-1)), Hg (1 mg kg(-1)), Zn (496 mg kg(-1)) and Cu (688 mg kg(-1)) were recorded for marine sediments. Increased heavy metal concentrations were also recorded in some flora and fauna species. For radionuclides in the last 5 years, the highest concentrations of Cs-137 (4500 Bq kg(-1)), Pu-238 (2 Bq kg(-1)) and Pu239 + 240 (43 Bq kg(-1)) were recorded for cryoconites, and the highest concentration of Am-241 (570 Bq kg(-1)) was recorded in surface sediments. However, no contamination of flora and fauna with radionuclides was observed.},

The marine geochemistry and metal sequestration in the marine sediments imply the present as well as past cli-matic conditions and elemental distribution, along with its dynamics. Various geochemical parameters were measured in the twelve sediment samples from Kongsfjorden. These were dominated by sand in the inner fjord and clay in the outer fjord area. The geochemical parameters such as organic carbon (OC) (mean 1.29\%), inorganic carbon (CaCO3) (mean 10.16\%), total nitrogen (TN) (mean 0.19\%) and total phosphorus (TP) (mean 0.08\%) show higher concentrations in the surface sediments of outer fjord regions. The concentrations of heavy metals are higher in the outer fjord regions and lower in the inner fjord regions. The various sediment quality-based indices analyses, such as the Enrichment Factor (EF) and geo-accumulation index, revealed high enrichment of heavy metals like Cu, Pb, Zn in the Kongsfjorden region, which is exposed to impending pollution from various sources. The modified PERI index values indicated that outer fjord region was under the level of considerable risk. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Research interest in the occurrence, distribution, fate, and toxicity of N-(1,3-Dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD) quinone, a derivative of the tire amino antioxidant 6PPD in urban environments, has surged. While several studies have found that 6PPD quinone exhibits acute, reproductive, and behavioral toxicity as well as mutagenicity and hepatotoxicity in aquatic and terrestrial animals, its environmental exposure data are fragmented and lack coherence across the source-to-exposure continuum, making it difficult to use for risk assessment and regulatory purposes. The present work developed an aggregate exposure pathway (AEP) framework to integrate the exposure data. An AEP network was developed for the atmospheric deposition of 6PPD quinone from tire wear in the Pearl River Delta, which led to human exposure. The 6PPD quinone research was organized, visualized, and evaluated with pertinent knowledge gaps identified using the weight of evidence assessment. Eight key exposure states were identified, with only two having high confidence levels and three having low confidence levels. Empirical support for the key transitional relationships decreased from High to Low from the source to the target site, indicating an urgent need for downstream mechanistic data. The proposed AEP framework integrated diverse 6PPD quinone research, facilitating a mechanistic understanding of the source-to-outcome continuum, as well as the development of quantitative predictive models for future research and environmental regulation.},

A key goal of the workshop was to provide potential users of metal bioavailability models with the information required to make appropriate decisions when choosing among mechanistic and empirical models. Workshop participants focused on the state of the science of metal bioavailability modeling, mechanistic and empirical model frameworks, validation of bioavailability models, and application of bioavailability models in risk-based decision-making approaches.

The aim was to document the levels of desirable and undesirable components in fish sludge in relation to a potential future use of sludge as invertebrate feed. The samples had variable, but relatively high protein and fat contents, indicating a high load of undigested feed in some of the sludge samples. Fatty acid analysis showed the presence of essential omega-3 fatty acids. In terms of undesirable substances, 43\% and 84\% of the sludge samples contained levels of arsenic and cadmium, respectively, which exceeded the EU Maximum Levels established for complete animal feed. The concentrations of copper, zinc, iron and aluminum were highly variable in the sludge samples. The concentrations of dioxins, sum PCB6, and chlorinated pesticides were all below the Maximum Levels for animal feed. Of the 18 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) only one compound (L-PFOS) was present at measurable levels. None of the samples had detectable levels of veterinary medicines, salmonid virus or bacteria. Performing a suspect and non-target screening of the sludge samples identified 18 compounds, including four pharmaceuticals, plastic-related products and the UV filter benzophenone, warranting further investigations. Overall, the results from this study show that fish sludge is a nutrient-rich resource; however, undesirable substances, originating from the feed or from treatment of sludge may be present.},

In recent years, accelerated glacier ablation has become remarkable in Ny-\& Aring;lesund. Glacial meltwaters discharge a substantial quantity of materials to the ocean, affecting downstream ecosystems and adjacent oceans. In August 2015, various water samples were taken near Ny-\& Aring;lesund, including ice marginal meltwater, proglacial meltwater, supraglacial meltwater, englacial meltwater, and groundwater. Trace metals (Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb), major ions, alkalinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, water temperature and electric conductivity were also measured. Major ions were mainly controlled by chemical weathering intensity and reaction types, while trace metals were influenced by both chemical weathering and physicochemical control upon their mobility. Indeed, we found that Br \& oslash;ggerbreen was dominated by carbonate weathering via carbonation of carbonate, while Austre Lov \& eacute;nbreen and Pedersenbreen were dominated by sulfide oxidation coupled with carbonate dissolution with a doubled silicate weathering. The higher enrichment of trace metals in supraglacial meltwater compared to ice marginal and proglacial meltwater suggested anthropogenic pollution from atmospheric deposition. In ice marginal and proglacial meltwater, principal component analysis indicated that trace metals like Cr, Al, Co, Mn and Cd were correlated to chemical weathering. This implies that under accelerated glacier retreat, glacier-derived chemical components are subjected to future changes in weathering types and intensity.},

The high reactivity of Cu-based NPs enables interactions with biotic and abiotic environmental components, leading to bioaccumulation and disorders in living organisms, such as fish in various life stages, especially in embryos or hatchlings. Increasing concentration of Cu-based NPs causes various toxic effects, mainly through the induction of oxidative stress. These effects include impairment of antioxidant mechanisms, as well as damage to genetic material, cells and tissues, growth retardation, metabolic disorders, increased mortality, or hatching inhibition. The aim of this review is to describe the release routes of Cu-based NPs and their adverse effects on fish, while emphasizing the need for further research on their toxicity and measures to control their release to the environment.

  abstract = {Mine tailing management is one of the largest environmental issues related to mining operation. This study uses chemometrics to assess the dispersion of iron mine tailing-affected sediments in Bokfjorden, Northern Norway. Metal concentrations (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) and physico-chemical sediment characteristics (conductivity, organic matter, sulphate, chloride, grain size, CaCO3, pH) were analysed in seven sediment cores collected in a transect out of the fjord along with two reference cores. Results of hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis allowed to distinguish between mine tailing-affected and non-affected sediments. Non-affected sediments were especially characterised by high levels of organic matter whilst mine tailing-affected sediments varied significantly in sediment characteristics depending on location in the fjord. Crucial parameters to reveal mine tailing-affected sediments varied between the target metal Fe along with metals of Cd and Mn, albeit less significant. Variations in mine tailing-affected sediment characteristics could be attributed to other anthropogenic activities in the fjord. Despite potential disturbances, chemometrics made it possible to identify dispersion of mine tailing-affected sediments to cover the inner and middle parts of the fjord. The study demonstrates the advantage of applying chemometrics on complex fjord systems, which in this case was used to distinguish mine tailing-affected sediments from areas with elevated levels of metals not necessarily related to the mine.},

  abstract = {Mine tailings from the iron ore mine Sydvaranger Gruve have been deposited in Bokfjorden, Northern Norway, for {$>$}40 years. This study investigates the environmental impacts of submarine tailings disposal one year after the cessation of the mine by combining analyses of total metal concentrations (nitric acid digestion) and metal fractionation patterns (sequential extraction procedure) of sediments with the metal uptake (bioassays) by sandworms (Alitta virens) exposed to Bokfjorden sediment. The analyses focused on metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Zn) in sediment cores retrieved from a horizontal transect of the fjord. High concentrations of the target metal iron was found in the fjord (N13,000 mg/kg). According to Norwegian sediment quality guidelines (SQG), cadmium (2.55 mg/kg) and lead (174 mg/kg) were the only metals to exceed good sediment quality at the source area ofmine tailings discharge. Despite general low total metal concentrations, labile (summarized exchangeable, acid soluble, reducible fractions) and potentially labile (summarized labile and oxidisable fractions) pools of mine tailings-related metals of cadmium (10-82\%), copper (25-88\%) and lead (10-67\%) were detected while iron were characterized as inert (residual fraction: 89-97\%). Despite spatial trends in total metal concentrations presumed to originate from mine tailings (Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb), there were no correlations between total and labile fractions. This can be explained by the high concentrations of iron, which under oxidised forms are suggested to inhibit a high lability of other metals. The metal uptake of sandworms was generally high compared to similar studies and exceeded moderate contamination classes for all metals compared to Norwegian standard values. Both labile metal fractions (cadmium, copper and iron) and total metal concentrations (copper, iron) showed positive correlations (r {$>$} 0.6) with metal uptake. Thus, both the total and labile metal fractions can pose an environmental risk. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Results showed that heavy metals, Al and Fe, are present in high concentration in the cryoconite samples. Al was also present in high amounts in seven of the eight lichen samples studied. The general scheme of elements in the decreasing order of their concentrations for most of the cryoconite samples was Al {$>$} Fe {$>$} Mn {$>$} Zn {$>$} V {$>$} Pb {$>$} Cr {$>$} Ni {$>$} Cu {$>$} Co {$>$} As {$>$} Cs {$>$} Cd while that for the lichen samples was Al {$>$} Fe {$>$} Zn {$>$} Mn {$>$} Pb {$>$} Cu {$>$} Cs {$>$} Cr {$>$} Ni {$>$} V {$>$} Co {$>$} As {$>$} Cd. Similarity in trends in the two sample types confirms that the environment indeed contains these elements in that order of concentration which overtime got accumulated in the samples. Overall comparison showed most elements to be present in high concentrations in the cryoconite samples as compared to the lichen samples. Within the lichens, elemental accumulation data suggests that the low-lying site (L-2) from where Cladonia mediterranea sample was collected was the most polluted accumulating a number of elements at high concentrations. The probable reasons for such deposition patterns in the region could be natural (crustal contribution and sea salt spray) and anthropogenic (local and long-distance transmission of dust particles). In the future, this data can form a baseline for monitoring quantum of atmospheric heavy metal deposition in lichens and cryoconite of Svalbard, Arctic.},

Significantly higher mean levels of PCBs (13 mg kg(-1) and mercury (16 mg kg(-1)) were found in blubber and liver, respectively, of seals from the Southern coast of Norway, as compared to the corresponding mean levels in seals from the Oslofjord (8.8 and 4.1 mg kg(-1)), and at the Northwestern coast (5.8 and 7.9 mg kg(-1)), respectively. A significant positive correlation was found between the concentrations of selenium and mercury.

Information on the size-distribution pattern of the trace elements in discharged waste water was obtained using the tangential cross-flow ultrafiltration technique. Instrumental neutron activation analysis, INAA, was employed to determine the concentration levels of Cd, Ce, Co, Cs, Eu, Fe, La, Rb, Sc, Sm, Sr and Zn. Lead, Cu and Ni were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy with graphite furnace, GFAAS, and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, ICP-AES. Almost all of the alkali metals Cs and Rb, the alkaline earth metal Sr and also Ni in discharged waste water were found to be present in the low molecular weight fraction. A major fraction of Co, Cu and Pb was present in the low molecular weight fraction, while a significant fraction was found as colloids, particles or both. Cadmium, Fe and Zn in discharge waste water were predominantly present as colloids. Approx. 50\% of Sc was present as particles, 100\% of Ce was present as particles, and most of the Sm was found as colloids. Due to coastal currents and trace element background levels in coastal water, the contribution of mobile trace elements to Norwegian coastal sea water is probably of minor importance provided that wood from highly contaminated areas is not utilised in the pulp industry. If the particle fraction accumulates outside the outlet, however, a local environmental impact over the years should be expected. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Direct and indirect influence of long-range transported air pollution is the major important factor for distribution of Pb, Cd, Zn and to a certain degree Co. Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations in lakes are important for Fe and Mn but also to a certain degree for As, Cr and V. Bedrock geology is the major controlling factor for Cu and Ni, with the exception of areas around the smelters in the Kola peninsula, where the Cu and Ni concentrations in lakes are very high due to local airborne pollution. Bedrock and surficial geology is also an important factor for controlling the concentrations of As, Co, Cr and V.

To address this deficiency, we analyze seven climate model projections of sea ice properties, assuming two different climate change scenarios [representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5] and two vessel classes, to assess future changes in peak season (September) Arctic shipping potential. By midcentury, changing sea ice conditions enable expanded September navigability for common open-water ships crossing the Arctic along the Northern Sea Route over the Russian Federation, robust new routes for moderately ice-strengthened (Polar Class 6) ships over the North Pole, and new routes through the Northwest Passage for both vessel classes. Although numerous other nonclimatic factors also limit Arctic shipping potential, these findings have important economic, strategic, environmental, and governance implications for the region.},

Sea urchins at the mine site contained significantly more copper, mercury and lead compared with the reference site for both the gonads and viscera, while the latter also contained significantly more iron, zinc and silver.

A trench was dug to collect all water from the pile and water sampled daily to determine temporal variations in runoff chemistry and to calculate the release of dissolved metals (filtered to {$<$}0.45 mu m in size) from the pile during the entire period with running water from June to September 2005. Dissolved and 'labile' fractions of 'total' Al, Mn and Cu were quantified in July and August 2006 by using diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT). Further, metal speciation was calculated for both 2005 and 2006 using the chemical equilibrium model WHAM VI. Predictions of the dissolved inorganic metal fraction using WHANI VI agreed fairly well with in situ measurements of 'labile' Al, Mn and Cu using DGT. However, for Al, the model overestimated the observed degree of organic complexation at the highest pH. Observations and model results for 2005 indicate that the highest dissolved metal concentrations, lowest pH, and highest inorganic (readily 'bioavailable') metal fractions occurred during an initial two-week 'spring flush'. In fact, more than 96\% of all dissolved metals were predicted to be 'bioavailable' during that period, which is considered affected by a release of pollutants slowly generated and accumulated within the pile during winter, but released upon thawing. Later in the summer period, both dissolved metal concentrations and the fractions considered bioavailable decreased markedly. This study shows that collection/treatment of spring runoff is essential to reduce the environmental impact at the study site. That conclusion is thought to have wider applications and may include waste depositions containing other types of material deposited in cold regions. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In order to shed light on the present contamination and possible effects in the fjord we initiated a range of studies including a pilot study on gill and liver morphology of common sculpins (Myoxocephalus scorpius) around Maarmorilik. Sculpins were caught and sampled at five different stations known to represent a gradient of Pb concentrations. Fish livers from all specimens were analyzed for relevant elements in the area: Fe, Zn, As, Cu, Se, Cd, Pb, Ag, Hg, Co and Ni. Lead, As and Hg showed significant differences among the five stations. For 20\% of the sculpins, Hg concentrations were in the range of lowest observed effect dose (LOED) of 0.1-0.5 mu g/g ww for toxic threshold on reproduction and subclinical endpoints. Likewise LOEDs for tissue lesions, LOEDs for biochemistry, growth, survival and reproduction were exceeded for Cd (0.42-1.8 mu g/g ww) and for As (11.6 mu g/g ww) in 28\% and 85\% of the sculpins, respectively. Similar to this, the no observed effect dose (NOED) for biochemistry was exceeded for Pb (0.32 mu g/g ww) and for growth, mortality and reproduction for Zn (60-68 mu g/g ww) in 33\% and 24\% of the sculpins, respectively. For all sculpins, females were significantly larger than males and for five of the elements (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Se) females had higher concentrations. The chronic lesions observed in liver (mononuclear cell infiltrates, necrosis, vacuolar hepatocytes, portal fibrosis, bile duct hyperplasia, active melanomacrophage centers) and gills (fusion and edema of secondary lamellae, laminar telangiectasis, mononuclear cell infiltrates, blebs) were similar to those in the literature studies for both wild and laboratory exposed sculpins and other fish species carrying similar or higher Hg concentrations. Ignoring sex and size, specimens with hepatic cell infiltrates had the highest concentrations of most elements, a relation that was also found for gill telangiectasis and Hg (all p {$<$} 0.05). When controlling for sex and size, the prevalence of vacuolar hepatocytes and endoparasites was significantly highest at the three most contaminated stations and similar differences were found for liver necrosis. We suggest that beside exposure to mining-related elements, other environmental factors, such as parasites, might be co-factors in the development of the observed liver and gill lesions. Therefore, sculpin liver and gill pathology are likely to be suitable health indicators when biomonitoring gradients of mining and other element related activity effects; while a larger study is required to fully evaluate the relationships.

  abstract = {Arctic seals are known to accumulate relatively high concentrations of potential toxic heavy metals in their vital organs. such as livers and kidneys, as well as in their central nervous system. We therefore decided to determine whether mercury, copper, cadmium and zinc levels in liver, kidney and brain tissues of three Arctic seal species were associated with the intracellular metal-binding protein metallothionein (MT) as a sign of toxic exposure. Samples from four ringed (Phoca hispida), five harp (P. groenlandica) and five hooded (Cystophona cristata) seals taken during field trips to Central West Greenland (Godhavn) and the Barents Sea in the spring of 1999 were used for the present study. In all three seal species concentrations of mercury. zinc and copper were highest in the liver, except for cadmium which was highest in the kidneys. Metal concentrations increased significantly in the order: ringed seal {$<$} harp seal},

Iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), and manganese (Mn) were mainly particle-associated. They are efficiently removed by sedimentation, while the dissolved concentrations of toxic metals like Cu, Zn, and As did not change. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentration was higher in the dissolved than in the particulate fraction. Sedimentation treatment reduced the particulate share by about 50\%. In contrast to metals, the dissolved fraction decreased by about 90\% during sedimentation, most probably due to adsorption to particles that are subsequently removed during the process. The concentration levels of 8 out of 16 PAHs, Cu, Zn, and As resulted in a water quality classification of poor or very poor. Acute toxic effects could be expected after short-term exposition. After sedimentation, this was the case for only two PAHs because more harmful compounds with three to six rings were preferably removed. These may adsorb better to particles than PAHs with two rings. No change was observed for the metals. A closer evaluation of secondary treatments of TWW, including conventional technology and mobile solutions, is therefore recommended. Finally, indications for a seasonal pollution variation have been seen, mainly related to the use of salt as a de-icing agent in road maintenance.},

  abstract = {The Arctic region is undergoing rapid and extensive transformations due to global climate change. This study investigated the spatial distribution of 31 chemical elements in eight locations in Billefjord, Svalbard, Arctic, with varying degrees of anthropogenic and glacial influences. The west coast of Billefjord has experienced a greater historical anthropogenic impact, while the east coast has larger glaciers and shows less visible evidence of direct human impact. Over 450 topsoil samples collected in the west (abandoned mining town Pyramiden, and glacial valleys of Elsa, Ferdinand, Sven) and east coast of the fjord (glacial valleys of Ebba, Pollock, Ragnar and nearby the Nordenskio center dot ld glacier). These samples were extracted and analyzed by ICP-OES. The results revealed complex distributions of elements among the locations. Nordenskio center dot ld glacier area, along with other locations in the eastern part of the Billefjord, had significantly higher levels of most elements (20 out of 31; As, B, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, K, Li, Mg, Mo, Sb, Se, Sn, Sr, Ti, Tl, U, V, Zr). In contrast, Ferdinand Valley and other locations on the western side of the fjord had the lowest mean concentrations of most elements (18 out of 31; B, Ca, Cu, Cd, K, Li, P, Mg, Mo, Sb, Se, Sn, Sr, Ti, Tl, U, V, Zr). These findings highlight the significant influence of glacial processes on the elemental composition of soils within the region. The meltwater flow originating from glaciers in the sampled valleys contributes to the local element load, while the loss of glacier mass is associated with decreased element concentrations within these valleys. These results underscore the complexity of element distribution in the study area and emphasize the necessity for continuous monitoring efforts in this unique and environmentally sensitive region.},

  abstract = {Over time, Norwegian fjords and harbour areas have received contaminants from industrial activities and urban run-off, and measures to remediate contaminated marine sediments are therefore needed. Stabilization/solidification (S/S) technology, in which the contaminated marine sediments are mixed with cement and other binding agents, has been shown to be a promising remediation technology. This paper summarizes a study of the environmental effect of stabilization, highlighting the importance of sulphide binding governing the leaching of heavy metals from the S/S of contaminated marine sediments. The study is a part of a research project focusing on developing effective methods for S/S of contaminated seabed sediments for use in new construction areas. Four cementitious binders were tested on sediments from six different locations: Bergen, Gilhus, Grenland, Hammerfest, Sandvika and Trondheim. The sediments differed with respect to properties such as concentration of contaminants, water content, organic content and grain size distribution. Portland cement, Portland cement with fly ash, industry cement, and sulphate resistant cement, were tested as binders. The leaching from the S/S sediments after 28 days of curing was measured by using a standard leaching batch test (EN 12457-2: 2003), with seawater as leaching agent. The eluate was analysed for pH and redox, as well as content of heavy metals and organic contaminants. Available volatile sulphide (AVS) and simultaneously extractable metals (SEM) were also measured in the sediments. This paper focuses on the leaching of lead (Pb) and copper (Cu). A reduced leaching of Pb after stabilization was observed for the mixtures, whereas the leaching of Cu from Hammerfest sediments increased substantially after stabilization for all cementitious additions. Experiments show that Hammerfest samples had lower values of AVS than the other sediments. This was confirmed by the SEM/AVS analysis, highlighting the importance of sulphide binding for mobility of heavy metals in stabilized marine sediments. For practical application of S/S technology to contaminated sediments, it is important to assess the leachability of the stabilized material taking sediment conditions such as AVS content into account. It is however important to be aware that the mobility of contaminants from a S/S sediment is dependent on a combination of contaminant concentrations and hydraulic conductivity (permeability). When devising S/S procedures for environmental projects, in addition to physical strength, the binder should be optimized in relation to leaching and permeability in order to achieve the lowest transport of contaminants through the material.},

The study demonstrates that surface peat is an excellent medium to study geographical differences in heavy metal deposition, provided that effects of the surface plant cover are properly considered. Long-range atmospheric transport of pollutants is the main source for As, Cd, Pb, Sb, and Zn, and to a lesser extent for Cu and Se. Biogenic emissions from the ocean appear to be the main source of Se to the peat. The metals Co, Cr, Fe, and Ni are mainly associated with wind-blown local soil dust. Surface enrichment of Mn, and in part Zn, is mainly caused by nutrient circulation between the surface peat and vascular plants growing on it. Deposition of marine salts appears to be the main reason for lower Mn concentrations in the peat near the coast.},

The concentrations of most metals decrease regularly along a northerly gradient. Comparison with data from other investigations in Norway regarding air pollution with heavy metals and levels of metals in different soil horizons strongly suggest that long-range transport of metals from other parts of Europe is the main reason for the excess accumulation of metals in the southern topsoils. Only in the case of Cu was this source found to be of minor importance. Deposition from metal smelters within Norway and in bordering areas of Russia are shown to cause elevated levels locally of copper and zinc in particular.

Metals and metalloids from the ammunition residues may leach into the soil and surrounding watercourses and may pose a threat to exposed wildlife and humans. Discharge of elements is dependent on several factors such as soil properties, hydrological conditions, precipitation and time. In order to identify strategies to limit spread of ammunition residues from shooting ranges it is of importance to gain knowledge of the mobility of the elements from the spent bullets. Here we have monitored the levels of Pb, Cu and Sb in a small drainage stream from a Norwegian military small arm shooting range in 2001 and 2006. The first campaign in 2001 was initiated ahead of the snow-melting period in the spring and continued two months in order to quantify discharge and discharge patterns of the selected elements in the drainage stream. Two shorter campaigns were performed in autumn 2001 during an excavation, and in summer 2006. Mean levels of Pb, Cu and Sb in the stream during the first monitoring period in 2001 were 14 mu g/l, 39 mu g/l and 9 mu g/l respectively. High flow, following precipitation, led to an approximately fourfold increase in the concentration of Pb and threefold increase in the level of Cu and Sb compared to low discharge concentrations. An estimation of discharge of the metals showed that the snow melting period and precipitation events constituted to a large proportion of the total release. A sudden increase in the levels can induce more stress and reduce survival of exposed aquatic animals due to the short time available for adaptation.},

  abstract = {Laminated sediments from Bolterskardet Lake on Svalbard provide a new 150-year record of heavy metals in the Arctic. Independent data of (CS)-C-137 and Pb-210 indicate that these laminations are annually deposited varves. The high sedimentation rate and varved sediments make Lake Bolterskardet a good site for studying history of heavy metal pollution in the region. A suite of heavy metals (Pb, As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Co, Ni, and Sn) were studied. The variations of Cu, Cr, Co, and Ni concentrations show an inverse pattern with the median grain size. It suggests that the particle size has a significant role in the accumulation and enrichment of heavy metals in the sediments. In the concentration profiles of studied heavy metals, only Pb concentrations show a significant increase from the lower parts to the upper parts of the core. Profiles of "total," "lithogenic," and "anthropogenic" Pb flux also show an increasing pattern. Anthropogenic Ph flux varies between 0.1 mu g cm(-2) yr(-1) and 12.3 mu g cm(-2) yr(-1), with a mean value of 2.4 mu g cm(-2) yr(-1). The anthropogenic Pb fluxes were relatively low at around 0.7 mu g cm(-2) yr(-1) prior to 1945, slowly increased after 1945, and reached a sidestep (between 1940s and 1970s) with mean value of 1.8 mu g cm(-2) yr(-1).

The variation of anthropogenic Pb fluxes before 1970 in Bolterskardet Lake coincides with the sulfate record and Pb concentration data from Greenland snow and ice, and the acidity concentration in the Svalbard ice cores. However, the anthropogenic Pb fluxes during the last two decades show a rapidly increasing trend. This regional pattern may suggest that local source is an important factor for heavy metal contamination in Svalbard, and the complex of long-range transport contaminations for regional and global process.},

  abstract = {Marine ecosystems have been heavily affected by environmental changes, which led to shift of prokaryotic diversity and distribution, especially in the Arctic Ocean. However, how environmental changes affect prokaryotic community still unclear. Here, prokaryotic diversity, community composition and spatial distribution patterns in marine sediments from the Bering Sea to the western Arctic Ocean were surveyed. The results indicated that the lowest bacterial and archaeal diversities were observed in the western Arctic Ocean. Moreover, the prokaryotic richness and diversity showed strong correlation (R 2 = 0.31 similar to 0.83, P {$<$} 0.05) with heavy metals (such as Cu, Zn, Ni and As). The contents of Ni and As repre-sented a range with in which biological effects occur occasionally in the Bering Strait, but concentrations of Cu, Zn, Ni and As in the western Arctic Ocean showed a probable effect range with in which adverse biological effects occasionally or frequently occur. Further-more, as geographical distance increased archaeal community similarity decreased faster than bacteria. The abundances of Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes and Thaumarchaeota significantly increased from the Bering Sea to the western Arctic Ocean. Conversely, much lower abundances of Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Crenarchaeota were observed in the western Arctic Ocean. In addition, all environmental could explain 73.8\% and 85.1\% bacterial and archaeal variations, respectively. And heavy metals could independently ex-plain 40.3\% and 30.4\% community variation for archaea and bacteria, respectively. This study emphasized effects of heavy metals on prokaryotic diversities and distribution pat-terns in marine sediments, which were helpful to deep understand microbial variation un-der environmental changes.(c) 2022 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

The concentrations of Cd in liver and kidney increased with age of the specimens analyzed. Significant interspatial variations in both hepatic and renal levels of Cd were also observed. Average hepatic levels of Cd in Baltic, Danish, and Greenland specimens were (age range) 0.05-0.09, 0.12-0.25, and 20.6-51.6 microg g(-1) dry weight, respectively. Such values for renal Cd were as follows: 0.55-0.71, 0.14-1.84, and 0.55-94.3 microg g(-1) dry weight. In contrast to Cd, concentrations of Cu in the liver and kidney of specimens from Baltic, Danish, and Greenland areas did not indicate such great interspatial variability. The average hepatic values amounted to (age range) 14.1-15.5, 22.1-63.6, and 16.3-25.9 microg g(-1) dry weight, and kidney contained on the average 7.83-8.80, 11.7-16.2, and 11.1-15.7 microg Cu g(-1) dry weight, respectively. The higher levels of hepatic and renal Cd in Greenland specimens than in Baltic ones could be explained by different food composition in the area studied. Baltic porpoises mainly feed on fish (cod, plaice) containing extremely low levels of muscle Cd, but an important diet component of Greenlandic individuals is squid, characterized by elevated levels of Cd.},

The main objectives of this paper arc defining chemical features of water within six small arctic lakes located in Bellsund (Svalbard) in the area of continuous permafrost occurrence. The unique environmental conditions of the study area offer an opportunity to observe phenomena influencing water chemistry, such as: chemical weathering, permafrost thawing, marine aerosols, atmospheric deposition and biological inputs. In the water samples collected during the summer 2013, detailed tundra lake water chemistry characteristics regarding ions, trace elements, pH and specific electrolytic conductivity (SEC25) analysis were determined. Moreover, water chemistry of the studied lakes was compared to the water samples from the Tyvjobekken Creek and precipitation water samples. As a final step of data analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed. Detailed chemical analysis allowed us to conclude what follows: (1) Ca2+, Mg2+, SO4(2-), Sr are of geogenic origin, (2) NO3(-) present in tundra lakes and the Tyvjobekken Creek water samples (ranging from 0.31 to 1.69 mg L-1 and from 0.25 to 1.58 mg L-1 respectively) may be of mixed origin, i.e. from biological processes and permafrost thawing, (3) high contribution of non-sea-salt SO42- {$>$} 80\% in majority of studied samples indicate considerable inflow of sulphate-rich air to the study area, (4) high content of chlorides in tundra lakes (range: 25.6-32.0\% meq L-1) indicates marine aerosol influence, (5) PCA result shows that atmospheric transport may constitute a source of Mn, Co, Ni. Cu, Ga, Ba and Cd. However, further detailed inter-season and multi-seasonal study of tundra lakes in the Arctic are recommended.

This article attempted to examine the concentration levels, temporal dynamics and long-term trends (19932009 and 19962009) of Al, Fe, Cu, Mn and Zn in streams draining the catchment areas of Skuterud (4.5 km2) and MOrdre (6.8 km2), located in south-east Norway. In the MOrdre stream, Al, Fe, Cu, Mn and Zn all showed statistically significant downward trends (p{$<$}0.05), whilst in the Skuterud stream only Al and Fe showed statistically downward significance (p{$<$}0.05). The general declining trends of metal concentrations are most likely associated with reduction of acid rain deposition in southern Norway. In spite of this declining trends, over the 1417 years of monitoring mean monthly concentrations of total Al (2.03.2 mg L1), Fe (1.32.5 mg L1) and Cu (8.926.1 mu g L1) in Skuterud and MOrdre streams, respectively exceeded the limits of the Norwegian Water Framework Directives, whereas the concentrations of Mn (22.340.8 mu g L1) and Zn (13.199.4 mu g L1) fell within the range of desired limits. Of the total water samples analysed from Skuterud (n=370) and MOrdre streams (n=255), nearly 8084\%, 7087\% and 7996\% were above the desired limits for Al (0.2 mg L1), Fe (0.3 mg L1) and Cu (3 mu g L1), respectively. In 2011, water analysis from drainage of forest soils (in Skuterud catchment) measured total Al: 0.420.79 mg L1 and total Fe: 0.841.0 mg L1 which were two to three folds greater than the desired limits. In general, weak correlations between runoff and concentrations of the metals in the streams were noted. Future research should focus on identifying the sources of Al, Fe and Cu and management interventions of elevated metal inputs to Skuterud and MOrdre streams.},

A wide range of chemicals are used as AF biocides, which have very different physico-chemical properties and therefore differing environmental fates, behaviour and effects. Copper has been used as an antifoulant for centuries and extensive research has been performed to understand how copper speciation influences bioavailability and toxicity. For biocides that have been widely used over a number of decades, for example Irgarol 1051 and diuron, there are a large amount of environmental data in the public domain, including for their respective metabolites, that allows their environmental safety and potential risk to the environment to be assessed. For other biocides such as dichlofluanid, DCOIT (SeaNine 211) and zinc/copper pyrithione, there is a good understanding of their fate and effects. However, few monitoring studies have been performed and not so much is known about the fate and effects of their metabolites. There are also new or candidate biocides such as triphenylborane pyridine, Econea, capsaicin and medetomidine for which there is very little information in the public domain. This review provides an overview of the environmental fate and occurrence data that are in the public domain for AF biocides and provides some insight into the effects of these compounds on non-target organisms.},

Our results show that trace metals in the top meter of the ocean are found in two clearly differentiated layers according to metal abundance and stoichiometry, namely the surface microlayer (SML) and its underlying subsurface water (SSW). Although metal concentrations in the subsurface dissolved fractions vary regionally and globally, it shows a singular metal stoichiometric signature. This work emphasizes the need to study of the SML as unique compartment to improve our understanding of the biogeochemical cycle of trace metals in the surface ocean, especially for metals, such as Pb, Fe and Cu, which are abundant in the SML.

At a 40 + -year old tailing deposition area for a copper mine in the Arctic fjord Repparfjorden, we investigated both short-term colonization of mine tailings-contaminated sediments through a field experiment, and the present faunal state in the old deposit area. Copper-concentrations at the old deposition site were still high (up to 291 mg/kg dry weight (dw)), and exceeded the Norwegian environmental-quality threshold (84 mg/kg dw). Furthermore, copper was identified as a sig-nificant structuring factor for the fauna in the fjord, although faunal diversity was relatively high and the community not severely disturbed. In the colonization experiment, experimental boxes filled with defaunated sediment capped with mine tailings were subject to colonization for 15 months. Benthic macrofaunal commu-nities were successfully established in all boxes, but the boxes with tailings showed lower species richness, abundance and biomass than the controls. Mine tailings continue to have local impacts on seafloor communities decades after deposition, and even low levels of metal-rich sediments can affect faunal recruitment. These results have implications for submarine deposition of mining waste and the impacts they have on coastal ecosystems.},

Several management measures were taken during the decline, including reductions in total allowable catch and a minimum size limit.

Semi-quantitative analysis by energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry with a collimated beam revealed that six flakes from European shelf seas were Cu-based antifouling formulations (without evidence of organo-Sn compounds), and five with a broader geographical distribution were Pb-based formulations of likely marine origin. Other elements regularly detected included Cr, Fe, Ti and Zn that were present in pigments or as contaminants from the underlying substrate.

Metal contamination in the marine organisms has been increasingly investigated, but most research focuses on few tissues, elements and species considered indicative. Baleen whales have been scarcely studied in this respect. Here we contribute to the fragmented knowledge on this field examining the concentrations of zinc, copper, lead, titanium and strontium in the bone of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) from NW Spain and W Iceland. Bone was selected because it is a tissue commonly available in archival historic collections, and it is therefore useful to examine long-term trends in metal pollution. We tested differences between populations and we investigated age- and sex-related accumulation trends, as well as the occurrence of placental transfer. Sr concentrations and Pb accumulation rates with age were significantly higher in individuals from NW Spain than in those from W Iceland. Placental transfer occurred, at different levels, for all metals: as a result fetuses showed significantly higher Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations than adults. After birth, only Zn and Pb concentrations significantly increased with age. Through this study we contributed to fill some gaps in the knowledge regarding metal contamination in marine mammals, and we concluded that bone can be a suitable surrogate tissue to monitor a number of trace elements, provided that dissimilarities in tissue-specific deposition are taken into account when comparing concentrations from different tissues.

The obtained values were compared with the published data on the fluxes of the same components carried by waters flowing into the seas. Based on EMEP reports, we made some corrections for the data on lead and cadmium fluxes from the atmosphere to White and Pechora sea waters, taking into account pollution sources from European countries and the contribution of processes of the raising of dust and soil particles by wind to the pollution of the European part of Russia. On the whole, the contribution of atmospheric fluxes of HMs to the formation of the environment composition of northern Russian seas is significantly lower than that of the runoff of rivers flowing into the seas. The White Sea is the exception; it is exposed to numerous anthropogenic sources of HM emissions into the atmosphere. It is also reasonable to expect the atmospheric transport of HMs to make a significant contribution to these waters. One can also expect a significant contribution of the atmospheric transport of HMs to waters of distant seas (the Kara and Laptev seas), namely, in the parts of these seas where the influence of largest Siberian rivers (Ob, Yenisei, and Lena) is insignificant.},

  abstract = {The Arctic is the most important, as well as the most vulnerable, region in the Northern Hemisphere with respect to climate changes. It is natural that climate changes observed on the globe in recent decades affect the environment in northern regions and processes determining climate. An analysis of time variations in these processes is important in understanding observed phenomena and in estimating their possible consequences. In this work, 30-year data series on the frequency of air-mass transport from Europe, Asia, and North America to the Arctic archipelagos of Franz Josef Land and Severnaya Zemlya and Wrangel Island have been analyzed, and statistical regularities observed in atmospheric-circulation processes in different seasons have been studied using atmospheric-circulation indices. The atmospheric concentrations of anthropogenic heavy metals (HMs) and their fluxes onto the surface of the Russian Arctic islands have been analyzed. The frequency of air-mass transport to the Russian Arctic from the continents has decreased over the last 30 years. Therefore, the composition of the atmosphere and precipitation over the Arctic becomes more and more maritime, which may affect variations in the properties of surface natural objects such as soil, water, vegetation, etc. Interannual variations in atmospheric-circulation processes are wide, which results in wide interannual variations in the atmospheric concentrations of anthropogenic HMs and their fluxes onto the surface. This also explains interannual variations in the content of HMs accumulated in the snow cover every year during the snowy season. Within some months and years, the maximum concentrations of nickel and copper in the air and snow cover of the Arctic islands may reach their concentration levels observed in less remote regions on the mainland. On the other hand, there are years, when no anthropogenic pollutants are transported to the Russian Arctic islands during the summer months. The main reason for seasonal variations in the concentrations of anthropogenic pollutants in the Arctic regions is in seasonal variations in the rate of precipitation of HMs onto the surface during their long-range transport.},

The conclusions categorized the current understanding of the outcome and ecotoxicity of MNPs in freshwater. The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) is recommended for environmental risk assessment as it provides a rapid and accurate risk assessment of an increasing number of novel compounds consuming fewer resources and animal tests.

The macrolichen Cetrariella delisei appears to be an interesting alternative to those lichen species used in the past (e.g. Flavocetraria nivalis, Cladonia sp.) for heavy metal biomonitoring purposes in the Arctic: it is widely distributed, easy to identify and reluctantly grazed by reindeer. Fieldwork was conducted in the summer of 2012 in the Kaffioyra Plain, Oskar II Land, NW Spitsbergen. C. delisei and soil samples were collected from 5 localities. Concentrations of Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd were measured in each sample. A bioaccumulation factor (BAF) was calculated for all the analyzed elements. The BAFs for Cu, Mn, and Ni showed a relatively low accumulation level in lichen thalli. On the other hand, the BAFs for Cr, Pb, and Zn, revealed an increased accumulation level in C. delisei. The Cd content in lichen is almost equal to its level in the soil. The statistical analyses covered three environmental factors: soil pH, substrate type and distance from the shoreline. The data were examined using the Kruskal-Wallis test, canonical correspondence analysis and a permutation test. The results show that distance from the shoreline had the greatest influence on the majority of the heavy metal concentrations in the lichen thalli and the soil. However, the level of Mn accumulated in the soil is determined by its source in the glacier. Moreover, the soil pH had the greatest effect on the Cd accumulated in the soil and the Mn accumulated in the lichen thalli. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.},

These included silvery lightfish (Maurolicus muelleri), Glacier lanternfish (Benthosema glaciale), Northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica), and Arctic red prawn (Eusergeses arcticus), and a large size-range was covered for each species. We found that the concentrations of most elements changed with size in the fish species and E. arcticus, and to a lesser degree in M. norvegica, likely due to its large growth variability which might have blurred the accumulation and dilution patterns. For the fjord samples, more elements were significantly associated with body length than for the offshore samples. Essential elements were mostly showing significant decreases in concentration with body size and growth dilution was suggested to be an important factor; however, further research is advised. For M. muelleri, Hg concentrations and {$\delta$}(15)N increased with size, while for B. glaciale, neither Hg concentrations nor {$\delta$}(15)N clearly increased with size in offshore locations, suggesting an association between Hg concentrations and trophic position. Regarding food safety, Cd concentrations might be of concern for direct consumption of whole individuals for M. muelleri and B. glaciale caught in offshore locations, as more than half of the individuals, meaning the smallest ones, exceeded the European legal maximum level. Our findings provide useful information on nutritional content and safety of these species as food and feed, and on their role in element cycling.},

  abstract = {Copper and zinc toxicity to the freshwater alga Chlorella sp. was determined at a range of pH values (5.5--8.0) in a synthetic softwater (hardness 40--48 mg CaCO3/L). The effects of the metals on algal growth (cell division) rate were determined after 48-h exposure at pH 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0. The toxicity of both metals was pH dependent. As pH decreased from 8.0 to 5.5, the copper concentration required to inhibit the algal growth rate by 50\% (IC50) increased from 1.0 to 19~{$\mu$}g/L. For zinc, the IC50 increased from 52 to 2700~{$\mu$}g/L over the same pH range. Changes in solution speciation alone did not explain the increased toxicity observed as the pH increased. Modelled Cu2+ and Zn2+ concentrations decreased with increasing pH, whereas toxicity was observed to increase. Measurements of extracellular (cell-bound) metal concentrations support the biotic ligand model (BLM) theory of competition between protons (H+) and metals for binding sites at the algal cell surface. Higher extracellular metal concentrations were observed at high pH, indicating reduced competition. Independent of pH, both extracellular and intracellular copper were directly related to growth inhibition in Chlorella sp., whereas zinc toxicity was related to cell-bound zinc only. These findings suggest that the algal cell surface may be considered as the biotic ligand in further development of a chronic BLM with microalgae. Conditional binding constants (log K) were determined experimentally (using measured intracellular metal concentrations) and theoretically (using concentration-response curves) for copper and zinc for Chlorella sp. at selected pH values. Excellent agreement was found indicating the possibility of using concentration-response data to estimate conditional metal-cell binding constants.},

Recently, it has been suggested by the European Commission that Cu represents a continent-wide risk to freshwaters. We assessed to what extent this suggestion is supported by the available evidence if Cu bioavailability is considered in the assessment of risk. We used several evidence-driven metrics to assess the continental-wide risks of Cu to European freshwaters. Such an approach is recommended and readily applicable where comprehensive data sets are available. We confirmed the validity of a bioavailability-based Environmental Quality Standard of 1\,{\textmu}g\,L-1 for Cu and used this to characterize the risks of Cu in 286\,185 regulatory monitoring samples from 17\,307 sites across 19 European countries between 2006 and 2021. These data show that risks, based on site averages and accounting for bioavailability, were identified in only two countries (Spain and Portugal). Investigation of these risks showed them to be highly localized to a single region in Spain and not reflective of the country-wide risks for either country. The 95th percentile of all the risk quotients for the continent-wide data set is 0.35. The relatively low levels of risk associated with Cu are supported by long-term trend data from sites on two large European rivers (Rhine and Meuse), where highly significant (p\,\&lt;\,0.001) decreases in Cu concentrations over the last 40 years can be observed. We conclude that it is critical to consider metal bioavailability in both effects and exposures in assessments of potential risk to ensure ecological relevance.

  abstract = {Identification of discrete stocks of Greenland halibut is an important aspect of proper fisheries exploitation. Available literature data indicated a lack of significant inter-area differences between Greenland halibut populations from the Northeast Atlantic. To define the population diversity, two aspects were taken into account: enzyme-genetic diversity and the concentration of heavy metals in tissues. Seven allozyme loci variations were used to characterize the genetic structure of four populations of Greenland halibut from the Western Barents Sea region. The samples were collected from the spawning area in the period when this species took migration to spawn. The sample RH4 was significantly different from the other samples collected from the same location (RH2 and RH3) and depth for over two days. Another sample (RH8), collected from the nearby area 6 days later was similar to the samples RH2, RH3. We noticed a significant divergence between the sample RH4 and the three remaining samples, where the value of the index FST fluctuated about 0.40 and approximately 0.01 between three similar populations. This genetic fluctuation negates the thesis of a panmictic character of the Western Atlantic population.Feeding groups of Greenland halibut are moving along the Barents Sea shelf and they are exposed to different heavy metals concentrations according to the food preferences or the exact place of feeding. We identified similar concentrations of heavy metals, i.e., Zn, Cu, Cd, and Pb in all samples. Trace metal analysis of aquatic organisms from the Barents Sea can provide important information on the degree of environmental contamination, and the potential impact of seafood consumption.},

Our goal was to determine concentrations of metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in dominant species of vascular plants, mosses, lichens, algae, and in the biological soil crust (BSC), and topsoil (0-3 cm) from various types of tundra in the southwestern part of Spitsbergen, Norway. Results indicate that mosses are more efficient bioaccumulators of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn than lichens. The highest levels of Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, and Pb were found in the BSC, and the moss species Racomitrium lanuginosum, Sanionia uncinata, and Straminergon stramineum from the polygonal tundra, initial cyanobacteria-moss wet tundra, snow bed cyanobacteria-moss tundra, and flow water moss tundra alimented by melting ice or snow. The observed higher concentrations of Cu and lower concentrations of Hg in mosses, lichens, and vascular plants compared with values observed 20 years earlier were apparently associated with changes in the atmospheric deposition of contaminants over Spitsbergen due to changes in the long-distance transport of anthropogenic emissions from industrialized areas. Prasiola crispa and Salix polaris may be useful bioindicators of Cd and Zn, and the BSC, R. lanuginosum, S. uncinata, and S. stramineum as bioindicators of Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, and Pb.

Therefore, we collected the terrestrial widespread moss Racomitrium lanuginosum (Hedw.) Brid. in Spitsbergen in the Arctic moss lichen tundra and, for comparison, in the Arctic-alpine tundra in the Karkonosze (SW Poland). Concentrations of the elements Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Li, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn in this species and in the parent rock material were measured. We tested the following hypothesis: R. lanuginosum from Spitsbergen contains lower metal levels than the species from the Karkonosze collected at altitudes influenced by long-range transport from former Black Triangle industry. Principal component and classification analysis (PCCA) ordination revealed that mosses of Spitsbergen were distinguished by a significantly higher Na concentration of marine spray origin and mosses of Karkonosze were distinguished by significantly higher concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Li, Mn, Pb, V, and Zn probably from long-range atmospheric transport. The influence of the polar station with a waste incinerator resulted in significantly higher Co, Li, and Ni concentrations in neighbouring mosses in comparison with this species from other sites. This investigation contributes to the use of R. lanuginosum as a bioindicator for metal contamination in Arctic and alpine tundra regions characterised by severe climate habitats with a restricted number of species. This moss enables the control of pollution usually brought solely by long-range atmospheric transport in high mountains as well as in Arctic areas.},

A systems-based approach aids in characterizing molecular events, and thereby the cellular pathways that have been perturbed. However, mapping only adverse outcomes of a toxicant falls short of describing the stress or adaptive response that is mounted to maintain homeostasis on perturbations and may confer resistance to the toxic insult. Silver is a potential threat to aquatic organisms because of the increasing use of silver-based nanomaterials, which release free silver ions. The effects of silver were investigated at the transcriptome, proteome, and cellular levels of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The cells instigate a fast transcriptome and proteome response, including perturbations in copper transport system and detoxification mechanisms. Silver causes an initial toxic insult, which leads to a plummeting of ATP and photosynthesis and damage because of oxidative stress. In response, the cells mount a defense response to combat oxidative stress and to eliminate silver via efflux transporters. From the analysis of the perturbations of the cell's functions, we derived a detailed mechanistic understanding of temporal dynamics of toxicity and adaptive response pathways for C. reinhardtii exposed to silver.},

  abstract = {This study develops and evaluates a mechanistic model of the hatching of zebrafish eggs that were exposed to CuO engineered nanoparticles (ENP) in a high-throughput screening system and places this model in an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) that also includes CuO ENP dissolution and Cu bioaccumulation. Cu2+ inhibits the proteolytic activity of Zebrafish Hatching Enzyme 1 and thereby delay or impair hatching success. This study demonstrates that noncompetitive inhibition kinetics describe the impact of dissolved Cu on hatching; it is estimated that indefinitely long exposure to 1.88 mu M dissolved Cu in the environment reduces hatching enzyme activity by 50\%. The complexity arising from CuO ENP dissolution and CuO ENP assisted bioaccumulation of Cu has led to apparently contradictory findings about ion versus ``nano'' effects on hatching. Model-mediated data analyses indicate that, relative to copper salts, CuO ENPs increase the uptake rates of Cu into the perivitelline space up to 8 times. The toxicity assessment framework in this study can be adapted to accommodate other types of toxicant, environmental samples and other aquatic oviparous species.},

  abstract = {The current testing of nanomaterials (NMs) via standard toxicity tests does not cover many of the NMs specificities. One of the recommendations lays on understanding the mechanisms of action, as these can help predicting long-term effects and safe-by-design production. In the present study, we used the high-throughput gene expression tool, developed for Enchytraeus crypticus (4x44k Agilent microarray), to study the effects of exposure to several copper (Cu) forms. The Cu treatments included two NMs (spherical and wires) and two copper-salt treatments (CuNO3 spiked and Cu salt field historical contamination). To relate gene expression with higher effect level, testing was done with reproduction effect concentrations (EC20, EC50), using 3 and 7 days as exposure periods. Results showed that time plays a major role in the transcriptomic response, most of it occurring after 3 days. Analysis of gene expression profiles showed that Cu-salt-aged and Cu-nanowires (Nwires) differed from CuNO3 and Cu-nanoparticles (NPs). Functional analysis revealed specific mechanisms: Cu-NPs uniquely affected senescence and cuticle pattern formation, which can result from the contact of the NPs with the worms' tegument. Cu-Nwires affected reproduction via male gamete generation and hermaphrodite genitalia development. CuNO3 affected neurotransmission and locomotory behavior, both of which can be related with avoidance response. Cu salt-aged uniquely affected phagocytosis and reproductive system development (via different mechanisms than Cu-Nwires). For the first time for Cu (nano)materials, the adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) drafted here provide an overview for common and unique effects per material and linkage with apical effects.},

  abstract = {Adverse outcome pathways (AOP) have been proposed as a new method to improve the ecological risk assessment of pollutants, but it requires quantitation linkage between exposure, biomarker response and toxicity of pollutants. A toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic (TK-TD) model was used to quantify AOP of the toxicity of Cd and Pb to zebrafish, including the quantitative relationship between Cd and Pb accumulation in gill and oxidative damage level based on ROS or MDA, and LC50 values at different times. Significant relationships were found between the oxidative damage level characterized by ROS and MDA content and Cd or Pb accumulation in gill (R-2 {\textquestiondown} 0.60), and the TK model could better simulate the Pb accumulation in the gills (R-2 {\textquestiondown} 0.60) than Cd. The increasing of Cd or Pb concentrations induced the generation of ROS and the formation of ROS initiated the fluctuation of MDA level in the cells as compared to controls (p {\textexclamdown} 0.05). For the individual level effect, the Damage Assessment Model (DAM) could successfully explain the change of LC50-ROS and LC50-MDA values at different times (R-2 {\textquestiondown} 0.99). Our findings suggested that the TK-TD model based on ROS and MDA could be used as a quantitative AOP to predict toxicity of metals to zebrafish. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Coloration plays a crucial role in the social communication and survival of organisms. Multidisciplinary studies have been conducted to elucidate the correlation between coloration and melanin biosynthesis (referred as melanogenesis). The multi-copper enzyme tyrosinase catalyzes the first two steps of melanogenesis for coloration in teleosts. Due to the increasing demand of tyrosinase inhibitors for the production of skin whitening cosmetics, hypopigmentation pharmaceuticals, and anti-browning agents, a large number of natural and synthetic inhibitors have been developed over the past few decades. Although a number of previous studies have focused on human use and toxicity, such as the increased cytotoxic effects of ROS-generating compounds, their ecotoxicological impacts on aquatic organisms are still poorly understood. Hence, the focus of the present review is to describe the role of coloration in teleosts as well as potential ecotoxicological effects elicited by exposure to tyrosinase inhibitors. Furthermore, this review introduces our recently registered adverse outcome pathway (AOP) related to tyrosinase inhibition and population decline in teleosts.},

  abstract = {Environmental risk assessment (ERA) based on effects caused by chronic and longer term exposure is highly relevant. Further, if mechanistic based approaches (e.g. omics) can be included, beyond apical endpoints (e.g. reproduction), the prediction of effects increases. For Cu NMs (and CuCl2) this has been studied in detail, covering multi-omics and apical effects using the soil standard species Enchytraeus crypticus. The intermediate level effects like cell/tissue and organ alterations represent a missing link. In the present study we aimed to: 1) perform long term exposure to Cu materials (full life cycle and multigeneration, 46 and 224 days) to collect samples; 2) perform histology and immunohistochemistry on collected samples at 12 time points and 17 treatments; 3) integrate all levels of biological organization onto an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework. CuO NMs and CuCl2 caused both similar and different stress response, either at molecular initiating events (MIE) or key events (KEs) of higher level of biological organization. Cell/Tissue and organ level, post-transcriptional and transcriptional mechanisms, through histone modifications and microRNA related protein, were similarly affected. While both Cu forms affected the Notch signalling pathway, CuCl2 also caused oxidative stress. Different mechanisms of DNA methylation (epigenetics) were activated by CuO NMs and CuCl2 at the MIE.},

  abstract = {Understanding how aquatic organisms respond to complex chemical mixtures remains one of the foremost challenges in modern ecotoxicology. Although oil spills are typically high-profile disasters that release hundreds or thousands of chemicals into the environment, there is growing evidence for a common adverse outcome pathway (AOP) for the vulnerable embryos and larvae of fish species that spawn in oiled habitats. Molecular initiating events involve the disruption of excitation-contraction coupling in individual cardiomyocytes, which then dysregulate the form and function of the embryonic heart. Phenanthrenes and other three-ring (tricyclic) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key drivers for this developmental cardiotoxicity and are also relatively enriched in land-based urban runoff. Similar to oil spills, stormwater discharged from roadways and other high-traffic impervious surfaces contains myriad contaminants, many of which are uncharacterized in terms of their chemical identity and toxicity to aquatic organisms. Nevertheless, given the exceptional sensitivity of the developing heart to tricyclic PAHs and the ubiquitous presence of these compounds in road runoff, cardiotoxicity may also be a dominant aspect of the stormwater-induced injury phenotype in fish early life stages. Here we assessed the effects of traffic-related runoff on the embryos and early larvae of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), a marine forage fish that spawns along the coastline of western North America. We used the well characterized central features of the oil toxicity AOP for herring embryos as benchmarks for a detailed analysis of embryolarval cardiotoxicity across a dilution gradient ranging from 12 to 50\% stormwater diluted in clean seawater. These injury indicators included measures of circulatory function, ventricular area, heart chamber looping, and the contractility of both the atrium and the ventricle. We also determined tissue concentrations of phenanthrenes and other PAHs in herring embryos. We find that tricyclic PAHs are readily bioavailable during cardiogenesis, and that stormwater-induced toxicity is in many respects indistinguishable from canonical crude oil toxicity. Given the chemical complexity of urban runoff, non-tricyclic PAH-mediated mechanisms of developmental toxicity in fish remain likely. However, from the standpoint of managing wild herring populations, our results suggest that stormwater-driven threats to individual survival (both near-term and delayed mortality) can be understood from decades of past research on crude oil toxicity. Moreover, Pacific herring embryos are promising sentinels for water quality monitoring in nearshore marine habitats, as in situand sensitive indicators of both toxic runoff and the effectiveness of pollution reduction efforts such as green stormwater infrastructure.},

  abstract = {The in vitro and in vivo toxicity of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) is attributed to both particle and dissolved copper ion species. However, a clear understanding of (1) the specific cellular responses that are modulated by the two species and (2) the temporal dynamics in toxicity, as the proportional amount of particulate and ionic forms change over time, is lacking. In the current study, in vitro responses to microparticulate CuO (CuO MPs), CuO NPs, and dissolved Cu2+ were characterized in order to elucidate particle and ion-induced kinetic effects. Particle dissolution experiments were carried out in a relevant cell culture medium, using CuO NPs and MPs. Mouse lung epithelial cells were exposed for 2-48 h with 1-25 mu g/mL CuO MPs, CuO NPs, or 7 and 54 mu g/mL CuCl2. Cellular viability and genome-wide transcriptional responses were assessed. Dose and time-dependent cytotoxicity were observed in CuO NP exposed cells, which was delayed and subtle in CuCl2 and not observed in CuO MPs treated cells. Analyses of differentially expressed genes and associated pathway perturbations showed that dissolved ions released by CuO NPs in the extracellular medium are insufficient to account for the observed potency and cytotoxicity. Further organization of gene expression results in an Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework revealed a series of key events potentially involved in CuO NPs toxicity. The AOP is applicable to toxicity induced by metal oxide nanoparticles of varying solubility, and thus, can facilitate the development of in vitro alternative strategies to screen their toxicity.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic metal pollution remains a substantial threat to remnant saltmarsh ecosystems as they continue to decline globally. Metal pollutants impart sublethal stress on saltmarsh halophytes evident at transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and physiological levels. Halophytes form the basal underpinning of saltmarsh ecosystems and as such changes to their physiology may have subsequent detrimental effects on higher levels of ecological organisation. This concept forms the basis of a mechanistic framework for toxicity: an adverse outcome pathway (AOP). AOPs facilitate the use of molecular and biological markers to predict consequent effects on population parameters, and community structure and function. We reviewed the current literature on common anthropogenically enhanced metals (Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb) in saltmarsh ecosystems internationally. The literature amassed to date indicates a lack of data in regard to the impacts of metals at higher levels of biological organisation and insufficient relevant data available to develop reliable AOPs. Collectively, metals impart sublethal stress at the transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic levels and targets of toxic effect are predominantly biomolecules involved in metal transport and detoxification, antioxidant pathways associated with metalinduced oxidative stress, and photosynthetic biochemistry. Thus, these targets would be useful biomarkers in future studies designed to develop AOPs in saltmarsh taxa.},

  abstract = {Due to human activities, soils become more and more polluted with metals, which imposes risks for human health and wildlife welfare. As most of the metals end up in the food chain through accumulation in plants, we need to establish science-based environmental criteria and risk management policies. To meet these necessities, a thorough understanding is required of how these metals accumulate in and affect plants. Many studies have been conducted towards this aim, but strikingly, only a few entries can be found in ecotoxicological databases, especially on Arabidopsis thaliana, which serves as a model species for plant (cell) physiology and genetic studies. As experimental conditions seem to vary considerably throughout literature, extrapolation or comparison of data is rather difficult or should be approached with caution. Furthermore, metal-polluted soils often contain more than one metal, yet limited studies investigated the impact of metal mixtures on plants. This review aims to compile all data concerning root system architecture under Cu, Cd and Zn stress, in single or multi-metal exposure in A. thaliana, and link it to metal-induced responses at different biological levels. Global incorporation into an adverse outcome pathway framework is presented.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have reported that the toxicity differences among metals are widespread; however, little is known about the mechanism of differences in metal toxicity to aquatic organisms due to the lack of quantitative understanding of their adverse outcome pathway. Here, we investigated the effects of Cd and Cu on bioaccumulation, gene expression, physiological responses, and apical effects in zebrafish larvae. RNA sequencing was conducted to provide supplementary mechanistic information for the effects of Cd and Cu exposure. On this basis, we proposed a quantitative adverse outcome pathway (qAOP) suitable for metal risk assessment of aquatic organisms. Our work provides a mechanistic explanation for the differences in metal toxicity where the strong bioaccumulation of Cu enables the newly accumulated Cu to reach the threshold that causes different adverse effects faster than Cd in zebrafish larvae, resulting in a higher toxicity of Cu than that of Cd. Furthermore, we proposed a parameter C-IT/BCF (the ratio of internal threshold concentration and bioaccumulation factor) that helps to understand the toxicity differences by combining the information of bioaccumulation and internal threshold of adverse effects. This work demonstrated that qAOP is an effective quantitative tool for understanding the toxicity mechanism and highlight the importance of toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics at different biological levels in determining the metal toxicity.},

  abstract = {The Hazard Index (HI) was developed as a quantitative tool for characterizing noncancer risks from combined exposures. HI, and related approaches, dominate assessments of such risks. Despite this dominance, HI has limitations: the widespread lack of data required to use the tool; the inability to deal with synergy and potentiation; and the inability to quantitatively predict the probability of specific adverse effects. This article provides a review of recent advancements in toxicology and exposure science and their implications for HI. The new find-ings illuminate aspects of the HI and reduce the limitations of using the tool.},

  abstract = {New tools and refined frameworks for identifying and regulating endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are being developed as our scientific understanding of how they work advances. Although focus has largely been on organic chemicals, the potential for metals to act as EDCs in aquatic systems is receiving increasing attention. Metal interactions with the endocrine system are complicated because some metals are essential to physiological systems, including the endocrine system, and nonessential metals can have similar physiochemical attributes that allow substitution into or interference with these systems. Consequently, elevated metal exposure could potentially cause endocrine disruption (ED) but can also cause indirect effects on the endocrine system via multiple pathways or elicit physiologically appropriate compensatory endocrine-mediated responses (endocrine modulation). These latter two effects can be confused with, but are clearly not, ED. In the present study, we provide several case studies that exemplify the challenges encountered in evaluating the endocrine-disrupting (ED) potential of metals, followed by recommendations on how to meet them. Given that metals have multiple modes of action (MOAs), we recommend that assessments use metal-specific adverse outcome pathway networks to ensure that accurate causal links are made between MOAs and effects on the endocrine system. We recommend more focus on establishing molecular initiating events for chronic metal toxicity because these are poorly understood and would reduce uncertainty regarding the potential for metals to be EDCs. Finally, more generalized MOAs such as oxidative stress could be involved in metal interactions with the endocrine system, and we suggest it may be experimentally efficient to evaluate these MOAs when ED is inferred. These experiments, however, must provide explicit linkage to the ED endpoints of interest. Environ Toxicol Chem 2023;00:1-16. \& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

  abstract = {An understanding of the combined effects of climate change (CC) and other anthropogenic stressors, such as chemical exposures, is essential for improving ecological risk assessments of vulnerable ecosystems. In the Great Barrier Reef, coral reefs are under increasingly severe duress from increasing ocean temperatures, acidification, and cyclone intensities associated with CC. In addition to these stressors, inshore reef systems, such as the Mackay-Whitsunday coastal zone, are being impacted by other anthropogenic stressors, including chemical, nutrient, and sediment exposures related to more intense rainfall events that increase the catchment runoff of contaminated waters. To illustrate an approach for incorporating CC into ecological risk assessment frameworks, we developed an adverse outcome pathway network to conceptually delineate the effects of climate variables and photosystem II herbicide (diuron) exposures on scleractinian corals. This informed the development of a Bayesian network (BN) to quantitatively compare the effects of historical (1975-2005) and future projected climate on inshore hard coral bleaching, mortality, and cover. This BN demonstrated how risk may be predicted for multiple physical and biological stressors, including temperature, ocean acidification, cyclones, sediments, macroalgae competition, and crown of thorns starfish predation, as well as chemical stressors such as nitrogen and herbicides. Climate scenarios included an ensemble of 16 downscaled models encompassing current and future conditions based on multiple emission scenarios for two 30-year periods. It was found that both climate-related and catchment-related stressors pose a risk to these inshore reef systems, with projected increases in coral bleaching and coral mortality under all future climate scenarios. This modeling exercise can support the identification of risk drivers for the prioritization of management interventions to build future resilient reefs. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2023;00:1-18.

We developed a Bayesian network (BN) to explore how climate model projections can be incorporated into environmental risk assessment (ERA) for a coral reef ecosystem, supported by adverse outcome pathways.This case study has demonstrated the potential of BNs to incorporate climate variables into ERAs to predict risks of combined stressors.The BN predicted a higher probability of climate and catchment stressors, causing increased coral bleaching and mortality, under all future climate scenarios.},

  abstract = {Chemicals mainly exist in ecosystems as mixtures, and understanding and predicting their effects are major challenges in ecotoxicology. While the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) and toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK-TD) models show promise as mechanistic approaches in chemical risk assessment, there is still a lack of methodology to incorporate the AOP into a TK-TD model. Here, we describe a novel approach that integrates the AOP and TK-TD models to predict mixture toxicity using metal mixtures (specifically Cd-Cu) as a case study. We preliminarily constructed an AOP of the metal mixture through temporal transcriptome analysis together with confirmatory bioassays. The AOP revealed that prolonged exposure time activated more key events and adverse outcomes, indicating different modes of action over time. We selected a potential key event as a proxy for damage and used it as a measurable parameter to replace the theoretical parameter (scaled damage) in the TK-TD model. This refined model, which connects molecular responses to organism outcomes, effectively predicts Cd-Cu mixture toxicity over time and can be extended to other metal mixtures and even multicomponent mixtures. Overall, our results contribute to a better understanding of metal mixture toxicity and provide insights for integrating the AOP and TK-TD models to improve risk assessment for chemical mixtures.},

  abstract = {Background: Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic heavy metal that widely detected in environment and accumulated in kidney, posing a great threat to human health. However, there is a lack of systematic investigation of exposure profile and association of Cd exposure with renal function in the Chinese population. Methods: Related articles were searched from PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Internet, and Wanfang to construct an aggregate exposure pathway (AEP) framework for Cd and to explore the correlation between Cd and renal function using random effects models. Results: A total of 220 articles were included in this study, among which 215 investigated human exposure and 12 investigated the association of Cd with renal outcomes. The AEP framework showed that 96.5 \% and 62.5 \% of total Cd intake were attributed to dietary intake in nonsmokers and smokers, respectively. And 35.2 \% originated from cigarette smoke inhalation in smokers. In human body, Cd was detected in blood, urine, placenta, etc. Although the concentrations of Cd in blood and urine from subjects living in polluted areas showed a sharp downward trend since the early 21st century, higher concentration of Cd in the environment and human body in polluted areas was found. Kidney was the target organ. The level of blood Cd was positively associated with urinary beta 2-microglobulin [beta 2-MG, r (95 \% CI) = 0.12 (0.05, 0.19)], albumin [0.13 (0.06, 0.20)], and retinolbinding protein [RBP, 0.14 (0.03, 0.24)]. Elevated urinary Cd was correlated with increases in beta 2-MG [0.22 (0.15, 0.29)], albumin [0.23 (0.16, 0.29)], N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase [NAG, 0.33 (0.22, 0.44)], and RBP [0.22 (0.14, 0.30)]. Conclusions: Foods and cigarette smoke were two major ways for Cd intake, and Cd induced renal injury in the Chinese population. This study enhanced the understanding of human exposure and nephrotoxicity of Cd, and emphasized the need for controlling Cd level in polluted areas.},

  abstract = {The advent of nanotechnology has significantly spurred the utilization of nanoparticles (NPs) across diverse sectors encompassing industry, agriculture, engineering, cosmetics, and medicine. Metallic oxides including zinc oxide (ZnO), copper oxide (CuO), manganese oxide (Mn2O3), and aluminum oxide (Al2O3), in their NP forms, have become prevalent in cosmetics and various dermal products. Despite the expanding consideration of these compounds for dermal applications, their potential for initiating skin sensitization (SS) has not been comprehensively examined. An in vivo assay, local lymph node assay: 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine-flow cytometry method (LLNA: BrdU-FCM) recognized as an alternative testing method for screening SS potential was used to address these issues. Following the OECD TG 442B guidelines, NPs suspensions smaller than 50 nm size were prepared for ZnO and Al2O3 at concentrations of 10, 25, and 50\%, and Mn2O3 and CuO at concentrations of 5, 10, and 25\%, and applied to the dorsum of each ear of female BALB/c mice on a daily basis for 3 consecutive days. Regarding the prediction of test substance to skin sensitizer if sensitization index (SI){\textquestiondown}= 2.7, all 4 NPs were classified as non-sensitizing. The SI values were below 2.06, 1.33, 1.42, and 0.99 for ZnO, Al2O3, Mn2O3, and CuO, respectively, at all test concentrations. Although data presented were negative with respect to adverse SS potential for these 4 NPs, further confirmatory tests addressing other key events associated with SS adverse outcome pathway need to be carried out to arrive at an acceptable conclusion on the skin safety for both cosmetic and dermal applications.},

  abstract = {Recognizing the extent of perchlorate pollution in the environment is critical to preventing and mitigating potential perchlorate harm to human health. The presence and distribution of perchlorate in Chinese environmental matrixes (water, atmosphere, and soil) were systematically investigated and comprehensively analyzed, and cumulative perchlorate exposure at the regional level was assessed using a combined aggregate exposure pathway method. The results showed that perchlorate is ubiquitous in the environment of China with significant regional differences. The total perchlorate exposure levels in each region of China ranked as South China {\textquestiondown} Southwest China {\textquestiondown} East China {\textquestiondown} North China {\textquestiondown} Northeast China {\textquestiondown} Northwest China. Although the average exposure dose of 0.588 (95 \%CI: 0.142 -1.914) mu g/kg bw/day being lower than the reference dose of 0.70 mu g/kg bw/day, it was observed that the intake of perchlorate in some regions exceed this reference dose. Oral ingestion was the primary route of perchlorate exposure (89.97-96.57 \% of the total intake), followed by dermal contact (3.21-9.16 \%) and respiratory inhalation. Food and drinking water were the main sources of total perchlorate intake, contributing 52.54 \% and 31.12 \% respectively, with the latter contributing significantly more in southern China than in northern China. In addition, perchlorate exposure from dust sources was also noteworthy, as its contribution was as high as 23.18 \% in some regions. These findings will improve understanding of the perchlorate risk and serve as a critical reference for policymakers in crafting improved environmental management and risk mitigation strategies in China and other nations.},

  abstract = {Current toxicity screening approaches to evaluate the vast number of environmental chemicals that require assessment are hampered due to their significant costs, time requirements, and reliance on live animal testing. The aim of the present study was to develop an adverse outcome pathway (AOP)-anchored transcriptome analysis (AATA) catalogue to expedite the discovery of environmental toxicants. 437 AOPs from the AOPwiki (https://aopwiki.org/) and 2280 transcriptomics data sets from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and EMBL-EBI ArrayExpress (AE) repositories were comprehensively reviewed and analyzed. By using the differentially expressed molecular key event (mKE) genes as connection nodes, we created a large-scale environmental substance-target gene (mKE)-predicted adverse outcomes (SGAs) network that included 78 substances, 1099 genes, and 354 adverse outcomes (AOs). To validate the reliability of the network, comprehensive literature verification was conducted. We demonstrated that 164 of the 354 AOs identified have been previously characterized in the literature. The results for 136 of these AOs were consistent with the predictions of the AATA catalogue, representing an accuracy rate of 82.9\%. Besides, distinct patterns in molecular KEs and AOs among categories of substances, such as biocides and metals, were demonstrated. Some representative substances, including atrazine and copper, pose significant risks to fish at various levels of biological organization. Moreover, experimental verification of the AATA predictions was conducted, including exposures of zebrafish to perfluorooctanesulfonate, cresyl diphenyl phosphate, and lanthanum. Results demonstrated consistency with predictions of the AATA catalogue, with an accuracy rate of 92.3\%. Collectively, the present findings support the AATA catalogue as an efficient and promising platform for identifying environmental toxicants to fish and thereby provide novel insights into the understanding of potential risks of environmental contaminants.},

  abstract = {Pollution-induced declines in fishery resources restrict the sustainable development of fishery. As a kind of typical environmental pollutant, the mechanism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) facilitating fishery resources declines needs to be fully illustrated. To determine how PAHs have led to declines in fishery resources, a systematic toxicologic analysis of the effects of PAHs on aquatic organisms via food-web bioaccumulation was performed in the Pearl River and its estuary. Overall, PAH bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms was correlated with the trophic levels along food-web, exhibiting as significant positive correlations were observed between PAHs concentration and the trophic levels of fishes in the Pearl River Estuary. Additionally, waterborne PAHs exerted significant direct effects on dietary organisms (P {\textexclamdown} 0.05), and diet-borne PAHs subsequently exhibited significant direct effects on fish (P {\textexclamdown} 0.05). However, an apparent block effect was found in dietary organisms (e. g., zooplankton) where 33.49 \% of the total system throughput (TST) was retained at trophic level II, exhibiting as the highest PAHs concentration, bioaccumulation factor (BAF), and biomagnification factor (BMF) of \& sum;(15)PAHs in zooplankton were at least eight-fold greater than those in fishes in both the Pearl River and its estuary, thereby waterborne PAHs exerted either direct or indirect effects on fishes that ultimately led to foodweb simplification. Regardless of the block effect of dietary organisms, a general toxic effect of PAHs on aquatic organisms was observed, e.g., Phe and BaP exerted lethal effects on phytoplankton Chlorella pyrenoidosa and zooplankton Daphnia magna, and decreased reproduction in fishes Danio rerio and Megalobrama hoffmanni via activating the NOD-like receptors (NLRs) signaling pathway. Consequently, an assembled aggregate exposure pathway for PAHs revealed that increases in waterborne PAHs led to bioaccumulation of PAHs in aquatic organisms along food-web, and this in turn decreased the reproductive ability of fishes, thus causing decline in fishery resources.},

  abstract = {Various silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) exist with different sizes, coatings, and shapes. AgNPs have unique physical and chemical properties, such as high surface-to-volume ratio and antimicrobial properties, which allow them to be used in a wide array of applications in consumer products and medical applications, including clothing, cosmetics, food packaging, medical devices, and wound dressings. They are also one of the most studied engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). Though the liver and lung have been identified as the primary targets of AgNP exposures, an increasing number of studies have reported accumulations of AgNPs in the brains of AgNP-exposed animals. These findings have raised concerns because the brain plays a critical function in our body and may have difficulty clearing AgNPs, unlike the liver and lung. Studies have been conducted to investigate potential neurotoxicity effects of AgNP exposures, but they use various types of AgNPs and routes of administration, which makes it difficult to compare across studies. Therefore, the goal of this review was to (1) assess factors that may affect AgNP-induced neurotoxicity, (2) identify potential mechanisms of neurotoxicity exerted by AgNPs, (3) review existing in vitro dose-response and in vivo exposure-response AgNP-induced neurotoxicity studies, and (4) provide an example application of benchmark doses (BMDs) in comparing across different studies. A combination of aggregate exposure pathway (AEP) and adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework was utilized to link AgNP exposure sources and routes to molecular initiating events (MIEs) and then to adverse neurotoxicity outcomes at the cellular, organ, organism, and population levels. This review is the first to propose an AEP/AOP specific to AgNP-induced neurotoxicity, which may contribute toward identifying plausible key event relationships between MIEs and adverse neurotoxicity outcomes and improving the current risk assessment of AgNPs.},

  abstract = {Exposure to atmospheric aerosols threatens human health and is yet to be effectively addressed globally. Aerosol toxicity strongly depends upon components whose chemical profiles and concentrations can constantly evolve throughout atmospheric transformation, inhalation, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Despite the abundant studies on aerosol components and their toxic effects, the dynamics in component concentrations and related biological effects from air to the body remain unclear. Here, we propose a conceptual toxicokinetic framework to mathematically deduce the bioavailable concentration from the changing bulk concentration of aerosol constituents in the atmosphere. The biological effects of single or multiple components are further predicted via toxicodynamic modeling according to their bioavailable concentrations. Atmospheric concentrations of toxic composition can in turn be regulated by risk-based guidelines, aiming to alleviate in vivo toxic effects. This perspective demonstrates how serial toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic equations bridge the knowledge gap between ambient aerosols and associated toxic effects in human bodies. The prediction from an inhalation perspective also allows connecting with the exposomes from aggregate exposure pathways. We call for the development of the model validity and integrate quantitative adverse outcome pathways to apply for exposure-disease modeling, providing novel insights into air quality policymaking and public health management.},

  abstract = {Metal contamination has become an increasingly severe environmental issue due to intense anthropogenic activities in recent decades. Many studies have reported a rapidly increasing trend of heavy metal contents in sedimentary records. In this study, two lacustrine sediment cores (LDL and YL) far away from scientific research stations were collected in Ny-Alesund and analyzed for the vertical distributions of 17 elemental concentrations (Cu, Zn, Pb, Co, Ni, Cr, Sr, Ba, Mn, P, Ti, K2O, Na2O, CaO, MgO, Fe2O3, Al2O3), CIA and TOC contents. The results indicated that only the proxies Pb, P, CaO, TOC, and CIA showed an increasing trend in the upper 7 cm section of the sediment cores, while most of the elements' concentrations decreased towards the surface. The rapid increase of TOC contents is likely related to the climate warming over the past 200 years, which promotes the prosperity of vegetation and thus leads to more input of organic matter into the lakes. Moreover, a large number of seabirds live around the sampling position and the seabird guano contains high concentrations of P, which could be regarded as an important nutrient source for vegetation. Additionally, the rapid climate warming could accelerate the chemical weathering rates, and thus lead to increased CaO contents in the sediment profiles according to its geological background. Therefore, the concentrations of other elements are very likely diluted by the high contents of organic matter and CaO in the upper part of the sediment cores. It is noteworthy that the rapidly increasing trend of Pb contents are related to the gas-oil powered generators in Ny-Alesund and long-range atmospheric transport from Europe. This study highlighted the nonnegligible influence of climate warming on the inorganic elemental geochemistry distributions in remote lakes. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Results show that the excrement of marine animals at higher trophic levels generally contained high levels of Hg, demonstrating the biomagnification of Hg through food chains in different remote regions. Significant variations in metal accumulation in the excrements were observed among the distinctive geographical areas, with the highest Hg concentration in Xisha Archipelago and the highest Pb concentration in the Arctic, which reflects different levels of air metal pollution at various sampling locations. Concentrations of Cu in the excrements primarily correlate to the geochemical background levels in the regions. High Cu concentrations were found near the Great Wall Station in West Antarctica where a copper mineralized belt exists. No clear spatial variation pattern was found for Zn accumulation in the excrement. This study shows that animal excrement can be used as bioindicators for the level of metal contamination in the marine environment, with the advantages of easy sampling, accurate detection (i.e., with high levels of metal accumulation), and reconstructing historical metal contamination trends by long-term monitoring of sedimentary excrements.

The main aim was to study spatial and historical variations in heavy metal concentrations, deposition rates and sources in the context of different metal transport pathways. Metal concentrations ranged from 5.7 to 45.8 mg kg(-1) for Pb, from 13.4 to 54.5 mg kg(-1) for Cu, from 0.01 to 0.90 mg kg(-1) for Cd and from 55.6 to 130.4 mg kg(-1) for Zn. Some fjords were unpolluted by heavy metals while in others a clear signal of metal enrichment was found (outer Kongsfjorden, Hornsund, Adventfjorden). Large-scale processes such as atmospheric and oceanic transport were found to be important drivers of heavy metal contaminant distribution. The significance of global drivers varied among the fjords, due to coupling with local processes. Outer fjord parts, the most impacted by oceanic transport, were characterized by the excess Pb-206/Pb-207 values of similar to 1.17, while the inner basins were characterized by the excess (206)pb/Pb-207 of similar to 1.14 suggesting possible different importance of Pb sources (marine currents and atmospheric transport).

By applying the threshold values, determining the boundary between good and not good status of the marine environment, set in this study, it was found that good environmental status has been achieved in the case of Cu in seawater and plants and has not been achieved in the case of sediments and fish for consumption. The study showed that climate change, the main feature of which is an increase in seawater temperature, significantly impacts the distribution and levels of copper in individual elements of the marine environment.

  abstract = {Trace metals (Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) were analysed in zooplankton samples and decapod crustaceans collected on cruises of "RV Walther Herwig III" to the Barents Sea (Summer 1991, 1994 and 2000). We found a substantial spatial heterogeneity in the decapod crustacean Pandalus borealis, with increasing Cd concentrations from the south (North Cape Bank; 0.7 mg kg(-1) DW) to the north (north of Svalbard; 4.7 mg kg(-1)), supporting the hypothesis that the frequently reported Cd-anomaly in polar crustaceans might be extended to the Barents Sea. Regarding various crustaceans and zooplankton collectives (2000) a distinct interspecific heterogeneity of metals was obvious, with lowest Cd concentrations in euphausiids and chaetognaths and highest ones in decapods and hyperiid amphipods; lowest Cu concentrations in chaetognaths and copepods and highest ones in euphausiids and decapods; and lowest Zn concentrations in euphausiids and decapods and highest ones in some copepods. For Pb many values were below or close to the limit of detection, suggesting that Pb concentrations about 0.4 mg kg(-1) might serve as a regional background value. Results for Cd, Cu and Zn in copepods of this study are largely within the reported range, but high Cd concentrations in copepods from summer in contrast to reported lower ones during winter/spring may be related either to changing accumulation strategies of the copepod species involved or to seasonally changing Cd absorption in copepods from food.},

Cd, Cu and Zn concentrations in field samples of zooplankton displayed a pronounced variability between taxa, with Cd ranging from 0.13 mg kg-1 (d.w.) in fish larvae to 5I mg kg-1 in hyperiid amphipods. Almost no information is available about metal requirements of copepods. However, most of our and worldwide reported Cu concentrations in calanoid copepods (6-22 mg kg-1) coincided with estimates of enzymatic requirements of decapod crustaceans. Cd levels in Calanus collectives increased significantly from 0.68 mg kg-1 in the German Bight to 11 mg kg-1 at some stations around Scotland above 59{$^\circ$} N, in line with literature data reported for benthic decapod crustaceans.},

  abstract = {The effects of ozone depletion on global biogeochemical cycles, via increased UV-B radiation at the Earth's surface, have continued to be documented over the past 4 years. In this report we also document various effects of UV-B that interact with global climate change because the detailed interactions between ozone depletion and climate change are central to the prediction and evaluation of future Earth environmental conditions.There is increasing evidence that elevated UV-B has significant effects on the terrestrial biosphere with important implications for the cycling of carbon, nitrogen and other elements. Increased UV has been shown to induce carbon monoxide production from dead plant matter in terrestrial ecosystems, nitrogen oxide production from Arctic and Antarctic snowpacks, and halogenated substances from several terrestrial ecosystems. New studies on UV effects on the decomposition of dead leaf material confirm that these effects are complex and species-specific. Decomposition can be retarded, accelerated or remain unchanged. It has been difficult to relate effects of UV on decomposition rates to leaf litter chemistry, as this is very variable. However, new evidence shows UV effects on some fungi, bacterial communities and soil fauna that could play roles in decomposition and nutrient cycling. An important new result is that not only is nitrogen cycling in soils perturbed significantly by increased UV-B, but that these effects persist for over a decade. As nitrogen cycling is temperature dependent, this finding clearly links the impacts of ozone depletion to the ability of plants to use nitrogen in a warming global environment. There are many other potential interactions between UV and climate change impacts on terrestrial biogeochemical cycles that remain to be quantified.There is also new evidence that UV-B strongly influences aquatic carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and metals cycling that affect a wide range of life processes. UV-B accelerates the decomposition of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) entering the sea via terrestrial runoff, thus having important effects on oceanic carbon cycle dynamics. Since UV-B influences the distribution of CDOM, there is an impact of UV-B on estimates of oceanic productivity based on remote sensing of ocean color. Thus, oceanic productivity estimates based on remote sensing require estimates of CDOM distributions. Recent research shows that UV-B transforms dissolved organic matter to dissolved inorganic carbon and nitrogen, including carbon dioxide and ammonium and to organic substances that are either more or less readily available to micro-organisms. The extent of these transformations is correlated with loss of UV absorbance by the organic matter. Changes in aquatic primary productivity and decomposition due to climate-related changes in circulation and nutrient supply, which occur concurrently with increased UV-B exposure, have synergistic influences on the penetration of light into aquatic ecosystems. New research has confirmed that UV affects the biological availability of iron, copper and other trace metals in aquatic environments thus potentially affecting the growth of phytoplankton and other microorganisms that are involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling. There are several instances where UV-B modifies the air-sea exchange of trace gases that in turn alter atmospheric chemistry, including the carbon cycle.},

Metal(loid)s content in these sediments varied from 2.36-41.90~mg/kg for As, 8.63-82.28~mg/kg for Cu, 0.14-0.71~mg/kg for Cd, 11.86-100.60~mg/kg for Ni, 8.30-27.58~mg/kg for Pb, 39.93-391.43~mg/kg for Zn, and 40.96-106.49~mg/kg for Cr. The pH and water-soluble organic carbon content had considerable impacts on the content of metal(loid)s in sediment, but the texture of sediment has limited influence on metal(loid)s content in sediment. In addition, the hotspots of most of these metal(loid)s appeared in the Beaufort Sea region. The geoaccumulation index (I(geo)) indicated that Cd was the metal with the highest contamination in these sediments, with 55.41\% of the sample sites posing moderate pollution. The ecological risk for As, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn and Cr indicates low ecological risk (100\%), while Cd posed moderate risk (35.14\%), considerable risk (54.05\%) and high risk (10.81\%) and attributed more than 76.45\% of the total potential ecological risk of these metal(loid)s.},

  abstract = {Phosphine (PH3), a reduced phosphorus compound, is a highly toxic and reactive atmospheric trace gas. In this study, a total of ten ornithogenic soil/sediment profiles were collected from tundra ecosystems of east Antarctica and Arctic, and matrix-bound phosphine (MBP), the phosphorus fractions and alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) were analyzed. High MBP concentrations were found in these profiles with the range from 39.59 ng kg(-1) dw to 11.77 mu g kg(-1) dw. MBP showed a consistent vertical distribution pattern in almost all the soil profiles, and its concentrations increased at soil surface layers and then decreased with depths. MBP levels in the ornithogenic soils were two to three orders of magnitude lower than those in ornithogenic sediments. The yield of PH3 as a fraction of total P in all the profiles ranged from 10(-5) to 10(-9) mgPH(3) mg(-1)P with higher mean PH3 yield in the ornithogenic sediments. The ornithogenic soils showed high concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), organic phosphorus (OP), inorganic phosphorus (IP) and metal elements (Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe, Al and Ca) but low MBP levels, vice versa for the ornithogenic sediments. No correlation had been obtained between MBP concentrations and IP, OP and TP. There existed an exponential correlation (r=0.67, p{$<$}0.01) between MBP and soil/sediment moisture. MBP concentrations showed a significant positive correlation with APA (r=0.668, p{$<$}0.0001), total organic carbon (r=0.501, p{$<$}0.0001), total hydrogen (r=0.483, p{$<$}0.0001) and total sulfur (r=0.398, p{$<$}0.001), indicating that the production of MBP is associated with microbially mediated factors rather than the contents of TP, IP and OP in the P-enriched ornithogenic soils/sediments. Our results indicated that MBP is an important gaseous link in the phosphorus biogeochemical cycles of ornithogenic tundra ecosystems in Antarctica and Arctic. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Seabirds are an important factor affecting the chemical properties of the arctic soil environment. The objective of this work was to study the differences in content and distribution of heavy metals in organic soils resulting from the differential influence of seabirds. Studies were conducted in two stations in the southwest part of Spitsbergen-the first without the influence of seabirds and the second directly affected by an avian colony. Basic properties of soils as well as total content of Ca, Na, Mg, K, Fe, Al, Cu, Zn, Ni, Mn, Pb, Cd, Co, and Cr were determined. Reference was made to the previously published contents of different forms of phosphorus (P) for these locations. The studies showed that Zn, Mn, Cu, and Cd contents were higher in the soils that had been in the vicinity of the seabird colony. High statistically positive correlations of Cd, Cu, and Zn were noted with particular P forms. In the case of Pb, Cr, Co, and Ni content, the seabird influence was not dominant; probably other factors were more relevant (the processes of weathering, denudation, leaching, and atmospheric pollutants transported in the form of dust or gases). Clear segregation was observed of individual positions conditioned by selected soil features and by heavy metals content.},
